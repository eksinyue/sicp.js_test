  In section~\ref{sec:implementing-the-query-system} we will present an
  implementation of the query interpreter as a collection of
  functions.
  In this section we give an overview that explains the general
  structure of the system independent of low-level implementation
  details.  After describing the implementation of the interpreter, we
  will be in a position to understand some of its limitations and some
  of the subtle ways in which the query language's logical operations
  differ from the operations of mathematical logic.

  It should be apparent that the query evaluator must perform some kind
  of search in order to match queries against facts and rules in the
  data base.  One way to do this would be to implement the query system
  as a nondeterministic program, using the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$amb$} evaluator of
  section~\ref{sec:nondeterministic-evaluation} (see
  exercise~\ref{ex:query-lang-amb}).  Another possibility is to manage
  the search with the aid of streams.  Our implementation follows this
  second approach.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
  The query system is organized around two central operations called
  <EM>pattern matching</EM> and <EM>unification</EM>.  We first describe
  pattern matching and explain how this operation, together with the
  organization of information in terms of streams of frames, enables us
  to implement both simple and compound queries.  We next discuss
  unification, a generalization of pattern matching needed to implement
  rules.  Finally, we show how the entire query interpreter fits
  together through a
  function
  that classifies expressions in a manner
  analogous to the way
  
    
    
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$evaluate$}
    
  
  classifies expressions for the
  interpreter described in section~\ref{sec:mc-eval}.
      </p></div>

      \subsubsection{
  Pattern matching
      

      
      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
  A <EM>pattern matcher</EM> is a program that tests whether some datum
  fits a specified pattern.  For example, the data list {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list("a", "b"), "c", list("a", "b"))$} matches the pattern {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, "c", x)$} with the pattern variable
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} bound to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("a", "b")$}.  The same data list matches the pattern
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, y, z)$} with {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$z$} both bound to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("a", "b")$}
  and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} bound to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"c"$}.  It also matches the pattern {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list(x, y), "c", list(x, y))$} with {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} bound to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"a"$}  and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} bound
  to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"b"$}.  However, it does not match the pattern {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, "a", y)$},
  since that pattern specifies a list whose second element is
  the string {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"a"$}.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  
  The pattern matcher used by the query system takes as inputs a
  pattern, a datum, and a <EM>frame</EM> that specifies bindings for
  various pattern variables.  It checks whether the datum matches the
  pattern in a way that is consistent with the bindings already in the
  frame.  If so, it returns the given frame augmented by any bindings
  that may have been determined by the match.  Otherwise, it indicates
  that the match has failed.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
  For example, using the pattern {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, y, z)$} to match {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("a", "b", "c")$}
  given an empty frame will return a frame specifying that {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} is
  bound to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"a"$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} is bound to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"b"$}. Trying the match
  with the same pattern, the same datum, and a frame specifying that
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$}  is bound to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"a"$} will fail.  Trying the match with the
  same pattern, the same datum, and a frame in which {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} is bound
  to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} is unbound will return the given frame
  augmented by a binding of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"a"$}.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  The pattern matcher is all the mechanism that is needed to process
  simple queries that don't involve rules.  For instance, to process the
  query

  
\begin{JavaScript}
job(x, list("computer", "programmer"));
\end{JavaScript}


  we scan through all assertions in the data base and select those that
  match the pattern with respect to an initially empty frame.  For each
  match we find, we use the frame returned by the match to instantiate
  the pattern with a value for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}.
  
  
      </p></div>

      \subsubsection{
  Streams of frames
      

      
      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
  The testing of patterns against frames is organized through the use of
  streams.  Given a single frame, the matching process runs through the
  data-base entries one by one.  For each data-base entry, the matcher
  generates either a special symbol indicating that the match has failed
  or an extension to the frame.  The results for all the data-base
  entries are collected into a stream, which is passed through a filter
  to weed out the failures.  The result is a stream of all the frames
  that extend the given frame via a match to some assertion in the data
  base.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
  In our system, a query takes an input stream of frames and performs
  the above matching operation for every frame in the stream, as
  indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:query-stream}.  That is, for each frame in
  the input stream, the query generates a new stream consisting of all
  extensions to that frame by matches to assertions in the data base.
  All these streams are then combined to form one huge stream, which
  contains all possible extensions of every frame in the input stream.
  This stream is the output of the query.

  <SPLIT>
    
    
      
\begin{figure}[H]

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  To answer a simple query, we use the query with an input stream
  consisting of a single empty frame.  The resulting output stream
  contains all extensions to the empty frame (that is, all answers to
  our query).  This stream of frames is then used to generate a stream
  of copies of the original query pattern with the variables
  instantiated by the values in each frame, and this is the stream that
  is finally printed.
      </p></div>

      \subsubsection{
  Compound queries
      

      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
  The real elegance of the stream-of-frames implementation is evident
  when we deal with compound queries.  The processing of compound
  queries makes use of the ability of our matcher to demand that a match
  
  be consistent with a specified frame.  For example, to handle the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$and$} of two queries, such as

  
\begin{JavaScript}
and(can_do_job(x, list("computer", "programmer", "trainee")),
    job(person, x))
\end{JavaScript}


  (informally, <QUOTE>Find all people who can do the job of a computer
    programmer trainee</QUOTE>), we first find all entries that match the
  pattern

  
\begin{JavaScript}
can_do_job(x, list("computer", "programmer", "trainee"))
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
  This produces a stream of frames, each of which contains a binding for
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}.  Then for each frame in the stream we find all entries that
  match

  
\begin{JavaScript}
job(person, x)
\end{JavaScript}


  in a way that is consistent with the given binding for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}.  Each
  such match will produce a frame containing bindings for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} and
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$person$}.  The {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$and$} of two queries can be viewed as a series
  combination of the two component queries, as shown in
  figure~\ref{fig:query-and}.  The frames that pass through the first
  query filter are filtered and further extended by the second query.

  <SPLIT>
    
    
      
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\maxsizebox{\linewidth}{0.8\paperheight}{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{{img\string_javascript/Fig4.5a.std}.svg}}
\caption{The {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$and$} combination of two queries is
        produced by operating on the stream of frames in series.}

\end{figure}

    
  </SPLIT>
  
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  Figure~\ref{fig:query-or} shows the analogous method for computing the
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$or$} of two queries as a parallel combination of the two component
  queries.  The input stream of frames is extended separately by each
  query.  The two resulting streams are then merged to produce the final
  output stream.

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p14' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  Even from this high-level description, it is apparent that the
  processing of compound queries can be slow.
  For example, since a query may produce more than one output frame for
  each input frame, and each query in an {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$and$} gets its input frames
  from the previous query, an {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$and$} query could, in the worst case,
  have to perform a number of matches that is exponential in the number
  of queries (see 
  exercise~\ref{ex:q-exponential-and}).<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a><a class='superscript' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>
      
  Though systems for handling only simple queries are quite practical,
  dealing with complex queries is extremely 
  difficult.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p15' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  From the stream-of-frames viewpoint, the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$not$} of some query acts
  as a filter that removes all frames for which the query can be
  satisfied.  For instance, given the pattern

  
\begin{JavaScript}
not(job(x, list("computer", "programmer")))
\end{JavaScript}


  we attempt, for each frame in the input stream, to produce extension
  frames that satisfy {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$job(x, list("computer", "programmer"))$}.  We remove
  from the input stream all frames for which such extensions exist.  The
  result is a stream consisting of only those frames in which the
  binding for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} does not satisfy {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$job(x, list("computer", "programmer"))$}.  For example, in processing the query

  
\begin{JavaScript}
and(supervisor(x, y),
    not(job(x, list("computer", "programmer"))));
\end{JavaScript}


  the first clause will generate frames with bindings for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} and
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$}.  The {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$not$} clause will then filter
  these by removing all frames in which the binding for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}
  satisfies the restriction that {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} is a computer
  programmer.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-5' href='#footnote-5'>[5]</a>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p16' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  The {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$javascript-value$} expression is implemented as a similar filter
  on frame streams.  We use each frame in the stream to instantiate any
  variables in the pattern, then apply the JavaScript predicate.  We remove
  from the input stream all frames for which the predicate fails.
  
      </p></div>

      \subsubsection{
  Unification
      

      
      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p17' class='permalink'></a><p>
  In order to handle rules in the query language, we must be able to
  find the rules whose conclusions match a given query pattern.  Rule
  conclusions are like assertions except that they can contain
  variables, so we will need a generalization of pattern
  matching—called <EM>unification</EM>—in which both the <QUOTE>pattern</QUOTE>
  and the <QUOTE>datum</QUOTE> may contain variables.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p18' class='permalink'></a><p>
  A unifier takes two patterns, each containing constants and variables,
  and determines whether it is possible to assign values to the
  variables that will make the two patterns equal.  If so, it returns a
  frame containing these bindings.  For example, unifying {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, "a", y)$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(y, z, "a")$} will specify a frame in which {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$}, and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$z$} must all be bound to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"a"$}.  On the other
  hand, unifying {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, y, "a")$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, "b", y)$} will fail, because
  there is no value for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} that can make the two patterns equal.
  (For the second elements of the patterns to be equal, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} would
  have to be {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"b"$}; however, for the third elements to be equal, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} would have to be {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"a"$}.)  The unifier used in the query system,
  like the pattern matcher, takes a frame as input and performs
  unifications that are consistent with this frame.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p19' class='permalink'></a><p>
  The unification algorithm is the most technically difficult part of
  the query system.  With complex patterns, performing unification may
  seem to require deduction.  To unify {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, x)$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list("a", y, "c"), list("a", "b", z))$}, for example, the algorithm must infer that {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} should
  be {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("a", "b", "c")$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} should be {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"b"$}, and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$z$} should
  be {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"c"$}.  We may think of this process as solving a set of
  equations among the pattern components.  In general, these are
  simultaneous equations, which may require substantial manipulation to
  solve.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-6' href='#footnote-6'>[6]</a>{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, x)$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list("a", y, "c"), list("a", "b", z))$} may be thought of as specifying the
  simultaneous equations

  In a successful pattern match, all pattern variables become bound, and
  the values to which they are bound contain only constants.  This is
  also true of all the examples of unification we have seen so far.  In
  general, however, a successful unification may not completely
  determine the variable values; some variables may remain unbound and
  others may be bound to values that contain variables.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p22' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Consider the unification of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, "a")$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list("b", y), z)$}.  We
  can deduce that {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} $=$ {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("b", y)$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"a"$} $=$ {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$z$}, but we cannot
  further solve for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} or~{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$}.  The unification doesn't fail,
  since it is certainly possible to make the two patterns equal by
  assigning values to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$}.  Since this match in no way
  restricts the values {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} can take on, no binding for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} is
  put into the result frame.  The match does, however, restrict the
  value of~{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}.  Whatever value {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} has, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} must be {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("b", y)$}.  A binding of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} to the pattern {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("b", y)$} is thus
  put into the frame.  If a value for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} is later determined and
  added to the frame (by a pattern match or unification that is required
  to be consistent with this frame), the previously bound {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} will
  refer to this value.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-7' href='#footnote-7'>[7]</a>

      \subsubsection{
  Applying rules
      

      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p23' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Unification is the key to the component of the query system that makes
  inferences from rules. To see how this is accomplished, consider
  processing a query that involves applying a rule, such as

  
\begin{JavaScript}
lives_near(x, list("Hacker", "Alyssa", "P"));
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p24' class='permalink'></a><p>
  To process this query, we first use the ordinary pattern-match
  function
  described above to see if there are any assertions in the
  data base that match this pattern.  (There will not be any in this
  case, since our data base includes no direct assertions about who
  lives near whom.)  The next step is to attempt to unify the query
  pattern with the conclusion of each rule.  We find that the pattern
  unifies with the conclusion of the rule

  
\begin{JavaScript}
rule(lives_near(person_1, person_2),
     and(address(person_1, pair(town, rest_1)),
         address(person_2, list(town, rest_2)),
         not(same(person_1, person_2))));
\end{JavaScript}


  resulting in a frame specifying that {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$person_2$} is bound
  to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("Hacker", "Alyssa", "P")$} and that {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} should be bound to (have
  the same value as) {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$person_1$}.  Now, relative to this frame, we
  evaluate the compound query given by the body of the rule.  Successful
  matches will extend this frame by providing a binding for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$person_1$}, and consequently a value for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}, which we can use to
  instantiate the original query pattern.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p25' class='permalink'></a><p>
  In general, the query evaluator uses the following method to apply a
  rule when trying to establish a query pattern in a frame that
  specifies bindings for some of the pattern variables:

  <UL>
    <LI>Unify the query with the conclusion of the rule to form, if
      successful, an extension of the original frame.

    </LI>
    <LI>Relative to the extended frame, evaluate the query formed by
      the body of the rule.
    </LI>

  </UL>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p26' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  Notice how similar this is to the method for applying a
  function
  in
  the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$evaluate$}/{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$apply$} evaluator for JavaScript:
  <UL>

    <LI>Bind the
      function's parameters to its arguments to form a
      frame that extends the original
      function
      environment.

    </LI>
    <LI>Relative to the extended environment, evaluate the expression
      formed by the body of the
      function.
    </LI>

  </UL>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p27' class='permalink'></a><p>
  The similarity between the two evaluators should come as no surprise.
  Just as
  function
  definitions are the means of abstraction in JavaScript,
  rule definitions are the means of abstraction in the query language.
  In each case, we unwind the abstraction by creating appropriate
  bindings and evaluating the rule or
  function
  body relative to these.

  Simple queries
      

      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p28' class='permalink'></a><p>
  We saw earlier in this section how to evaluate simple queries in the
  absence of rules.  Now that we have seen how to apply rules, we can
  describe how to evaluate simple queries by using both rules and
  assertions.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p29' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Given the query pattern and a stream of frames, we produce, for each
  frame in the input stream, two streams:

  <UL>
    <LI>a stream of extended frames obtained by matching the pattern
      against all assertions in the data base (using the pattern matcher),
      and

        generalization of matching, we could simplify the system by using the

        full-blown unification) can be useful in its own right.</FOOTNOTE></div></UL>

  Appending these two streams produces a stream that consists of all the
  ways that the given pattern can be satisfied consistent with the
  original frame.  These streams (one for each frame in the input
  stream) are now all combined to form one large stream, which therefore
  consists of all the ways that any of the frames in the original input
  stream can be extended to produce a match with the given pattern.

  Despite the complexity of the underlying matching operations, the
  system is organized much like an evaluator for any language.  The
  function
  that coordinates the matching operations is called 
  
  
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$qeval$}, and it plays a role analogous to that of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$evaluate$}
  function
  for JavaScript.  The function {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$qeval$} takes as inputs a query and a stream
  of frames.  Its output is a stream of frames, corresponding to
  successful matches to the query pattern, that extend some frame in the
  input stream, as indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:query-stream}.  Like
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$evaluate$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$qeval$} classifies the different types of expressions
  (queries) and dispatches to an appropriate
  function
  for each.  There
  is a
  function
  for each special form ({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$and$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$or$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$not$},
  and
    
    
    
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$javascript_value$})
    
  
  and one for simple queries.

  The driver loop, which is analogous to the
  
  
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$driver_loop$}
  
  function
  for the other evaluators in this chapter, reads queries from the
  terminal.  For each query, it calls {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$qeval$} with the query and a
  stream that consists of a single empty frame.  This will produce the
  stream of all possible matches (all possible extensions to the empty
  frame).  For each frame in the resulting stream, it instantiates the
  original query using the values of the variables found in the frame.
  This stream of instantiated queries is then 
  printed.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-9' href='#footnote-9'>[9]</a>

  The driver also checks for the special command {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$assert$}, which
  signals that the input is not a query but rather an assertion or rule
  to be added to the data base.  For instance,

  
\begin{JavaScript}
assert(job(list("Bitdiddle", "Ben"), list("computer", "wizard")));

assert(rule(wheel(person),
            and(supervisor(middle-manager, person),
                supervisor(x, middle-manager))));
\end{JavaScript}

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-9' href='#footnote-link-9'>[9] </a><FOOTNOTE>Because matching is generally very expensive, we would
    
    like to avoid applying the full matcher to every element of the data
    base.  This is usually arranged by breaking up the process into a
    fast, coarse match and the final match.  The coarse match filters the
    data base to produce a small set of candidates for the final match.
    With care, we can arrange our data base so that some of the work of
    coarse matching can be done when the data base is constructed rather
    
    then when we want to select the candidates.  This is called <EM>
      indexing</EM> the data base.  There is a vast technology built around
    data-base-indexing schemes.  Our implementation, described in
    section~\ref{sec:implementing-the-query-system}, contains a
    simple-minded form of such an optimization.</FOOTNOTE></div><hr><div class='footnote'>

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-9' href='#footnote-link-9'>[9] </a><FOOTNOTE>Another way to think of unification is that it generates the most
    general pattern that is a specialization of the two input patterns.
    That is, the unification of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, "a")$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list("b", y), z)$} is {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list("b", y), "a")$}, and the unification of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(x, "a", y)$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(y, z, "a")$}, discussed above, is {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list("a", "a", "a")$}.
    For our implementation, it is more convenient to think of the result
    of unification as a frame rather than a pattern.</FOOTNOTE></div><hr><div class='footnote'>
<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-9' href='#footnote-link-9'>[9] </a><FOOTNOTE>The reason we use streams (rather than lists) of frames is that the
    
    
    recursive application of rules can generate
    infinite numbers of values that satisfy a query.  The delayed
    evaluation embodied in streams is crucial here: The system will print
    responses one by one as they are generated, regardless of whether
    there are a finite or infinite number of responses.</FOOTNOTE></div>
