    In section~\ref{sec:delayed-lists}, we showed how to
    implement streams as delayed lists.
    
      
      
	We used a function definition expression
      
    
    to construct a <QUOTE>promise</QUOTE> to compute
    the
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$tail$}
    of a stream, without actually fulfilling that promise
    until later.
    
      
      
	We were forced to create streams as a new kind of data object
	similar but not identical to lists, and this required us to
	reimplement many ordinary list operations
	({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$map$},
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$append$}, and
	so on) for use with streams.

    With lazy evaluation, streams and lists can be identical, so there is
    no need for
    
    separate list and stream operations.
    All we need to do is to arrange matters so that
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$pair$}
    is non-strict.  One way to accomplish this is to extend the lazy
    evaluator to allow for non-strict primitives, and to implement
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$pair$}
    as one of these.  An easier way is to recall
    (section~\ref{sec:data?}) that there is no fundamental
    need to implement
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$pair$}
    as a primitive at all.  Instead, we can represent
    
    pairs as
    functions:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
function pair(x, y) {	
    return m => m(x, y);
}
function head(z) {    
    return z( (p, q) => p );
}
function tail(z) {
    return z( (p, q) => q );
}
\end{JavaScript}

  

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function pair(x, y) {	
    return m => m(x, y);
}
function head(z) {    
    return z( (p, q) => p );
}
function tail(z) {
    return z( (p, q) => q );
}
\end{JavaScript}

    In terms of these basic operations, the standard definitions of the
    list operations will work with infinite lists (streams) as well as
    finite ones, and the stream operations can be implemented as list operations.
    Here are some examples:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function list_ref(items, n) {	
    return n === 0
           ? head(items)
           : list_ref(tail(items), n - 1);
}
function map(fun, items) {	   
    return is_null(items)
           ? null
           : pair(fun(head(items)),
                  map(fun, tail(items)));
}
function scale_list(items, factor) {
    return map(x => x * factor, items);
}
function add_lists(list1, list2) {
    return is_null(list1)
           ? list2
           : is_null(list2)    
             ? list1
             : pair(head(list1) + head(list2),
                    add_lists(tail(list1),
                              tail(list2)));
}
const ones = pair(1, ones);
const integers = pair(1, add_lists(ones, integers));

list_ref(integers, 17); // returns 18
\end{JavaScript}

    Note that these lazy lists are even lazier than the streams of
    chapter~3:  The
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$head$}
    of the list, as well as the
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$tail$},
    is delayed.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$head$}
    or
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$tail$}
    of a lazy pair need not force the value of a list element.  The value will be
    forced only when it is really needed—e.g., for use as the
    argument of a primitive, or to be printed as an answer.
  
    In fact, even accessing the
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$head$}
    or
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$tail$}
    of a lazy pair need not force the value of a list element.  The value will be
    forced only when it is really needed—e.g., for use as the
    argument of a primitive, or to be printed as an answer.

    Lazy pairs also help with the problem that arose with streams in
    section~\ref{sec:streams-and-delayed-evaluation}, where we found
    that formulating stream models of systems with loops may require us to
    sprinkle our programs with
    
      
      
    
    
    additional delayed function definitions,
    beyond the ones required to construct a stream pair.
      
    
    With lazy evaluation, all
    arguments to
    functions
    are delayed uniformly.  For instance, we can implement
    functions
    to integrate lists and solve differential equations as we originally intended in
    section~\ref{sec:streams-and-delayed-evaluation}:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function integral(integrand, initial_value, dt) {	
    const int =
        pair(initial_value,
             add_lists(scale_list(integrand, dt),
                       int));
    return int;
}
function solve(f, y0, dt) {
    const y = integral(dy, y0, dt);
    const dy = map(f, y);
    return y;
}
list_ref(solve(x => x, 1, 0.001), 1000);
\end{JavaScript}

\begin{Exercise}

    Give some examples that illustrate the difference between the streams
    of chapter~3 and the <QUOTE>lazier</QUOTE> lazy lists described in
    this section. How can you take advantage of this extra laziness?
  
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Exercise}

    Ben Bitdiddle tests the lazy list implementation given above by
    evaluating the expression
    
\begin{JavaScript}
head(list(a, b, c));
\end{JavaScript}

    To his surprise, this produces an error.  After some thought, he
    realizes that the <QUOTE>lists</QUOTE> obtained by reading in quoted expressions
    are different from the lists manipulated by the new definitions of
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$pair$},
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$head$},
    and
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$tail$}.
    Modify the evaluator's treatment of
    
      
      
	applications of the primitive function l
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list$}
      
    
    typed at the driver loop will produce true lazy lists.
    
  
\end{Exercise}


  
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

    Modify the driver loop for the evaluator so that lazy pairs and lists
    will print in some reasonable way.  (What are you going to do about
    infinite lists?)  You may also need to modify the representation of
    lazy pairs so that the evaluator can identify them in order
    to print them.
    
  
\end{Exercise}
