    Now that we have an evaluator expressed as a
    
    JavaScript
    program, we can experiment with alternative choices in language design
    simply by modifying the evaluator.  Indeed, new languages are often
    invented by first writing an evaluator that embeds the new language
    within an existing high-level language.  For example, if we wish to
    discuss some aspect of a proposed modification to
    
    JavaScript
    with another member of the
    
    JavaScript
    community, we can supply an evaluator that embodies
    the change.  The recipient can then experiment with the new
    evaluator and send back comments as further modifications.  Not only
    does the high-level implementation base make it easier to test and
    debug the evaluator; in addition, the embedding enables the designer
    to snarf<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
    JavaScript
    evaluator uses primitives and control structure from the underlying
    
    JavaScript.
    Only later (if ever) need the designer go to the trouble of building a
    complete implementation in a low-level language or in hardware.  In
    this section and the next we explore some variations on
    
    JavaScript
    that provide significant additional expressive power.
