    In section~\ref{sec:elements-of-programming}, where we began our
    discussion of models of evaluation, we noted that
    
    JavaScript
    is an <EM>
    applicative-order</EM> language, namely, that all the arguments to
    
    JavaScript
    
    functions
    are evaluated when the
    
    function
    is applied.  In
    contrast, <EM>normal-order</EM> languages delay evaluation of
    
    function
    arguments until the actual argument values are needed. Delaying evaluation of
    
    function
    arguments until the
    last possible moment (e.g., until they are required by a primitive
    operation) is called 
    
    <EM>lazy evaluation</EM>.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>

    Consider the
    
    function

    
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function try_me(a, b) {
    return a === 0 ? 1 : b;

    Evaluating
    
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$try_me(0, head(null));$}
    
    generates an error in
    
      
      JavaScript.
    
    With lazy evaluation, there would be no error.  Evaluating the expression
    would return 1, because the argument
    
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$head(null)$}
    
    would never be evaluated.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
    An example that exploits lazy evaluation is the definition of a
    function
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$}

    

    that can be used in expressions such as

    
\begin{JavaScript}
unless(xs === null,
       head(xs),	
       display("error: xs should not be null"));
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
    This won't work in an applicative-order language because both the
    usual value and the exceptional value will be evaluated before
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$}
    is called (compare exercise~\ref{ex:new-if}).
    An advantage of lazy evaluation is that some
    
    functions,
    such as {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$}, can do useful computation
    even if evaluation of some of their arguments would produce errors or
    would not terminate.

<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
    If the body of a
    
    function
    is entered before an argument has been evaluated we say that the
    
    function
    is 
    
    <EM>non-strict</EM> in that
    argument.  If the argument is evaluated before the body of the
    
    function
    is entered we say that the
    
    function
    is 
    
    <EM>strict</EM> in that
    argument.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
    In a purely applicative-order language, all
    
    functions
    are strict in
    each argument.  In a purely normal-order language, all compound
    
    functions
    are non-strict in each argument, and primitive
    
    functions
    may be
    either strict or non-strict.  There are also languages (see
    exercise~\ref{ex:user-controlled-strictness}) that give programmers
    detailed control over the strictness of the
    
    functions
    they define.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
    A striking example of a
    
    function
    that can usefully be made non-strict
    is
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$pair$}
    (or, in general, almost any constructor for data structures).
    One can do useful computation, combining elements to form
    data structures and operating on the resulting data structures,
    even if the values of the elements are not known.  It makes perfect
    sense, for instance, to compute the length of a list without knowing
    the values of the individual elements in the list.  We will exploit
    this idea in section~\ref{sec:lazy-cons} to implement the
    streams of chapter~3 as lists formed of non-strict
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$pair$}
    pairs.

\begin{Exercise}

    
      
      
	Suppose that (in ordinary applicative-order JavaScript) we define
      
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$}
    as shown above and then define {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$factorial$} in terms
    of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$} as

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function factorial(n) {
    return unless(n === 1,
                  n * factorial(n - 1),
                  1);
}
\end{JavaScript}


    

    What happens if we attempt to evaluate
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$factorial(5)$}?
    
    Will our definitions work in a normal-order language?
  
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Exercise}

    
    
    Ben Bitdiddle and Alyssa P. Hacker disagree over the importance of
    lazy evaluation for implementing things such as {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$}.
    Ben points out that it's possible to implement {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$}
    in applicative order as a
    
    new kind of expression,
    akin to conditional expressions.
    
    Alyssa counters that, if one did that,
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$} would be merely syntax, not a
    
    function
    that could be used in conjunction with higher-order
    
    functions.
    Fill in the details on both sides of the argument.
    
      
      
	Show how to define the evaluation of 
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$} as a new kind of expression
	(as we defined the evaluation of conditional expressions in
	section~\ref{sec:conditionals}),
	and give an example of a situation where it might be useful to have
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unless$} available as a function,
	rather than as a new expression syntax.
