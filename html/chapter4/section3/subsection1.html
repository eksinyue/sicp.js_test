  To extend JavaScript
  to support nondeterminism, we introduce a new kind of expression called <kbd>amb</kbd>.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p2' class='permalink'></a><p>
	The expression
	
	<kbd>amb(</kbd>$e_1,\ e_2,\ldots, e_n$<kbd>)</kbd>
  returns the value of one of the $n$ expressions $e_i$ <QUOTE>ambiguously.</QUOTE>
  For example, the expression

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_85_1_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
list(amb(1, 2, 3), amb("a", "b"))
</pre></div></div>

  can have six possible values:
  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_85_2_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
list(1, "a") list(1, "b") list(2, "a") list(2, "b") list(3, "a") list(3, "b")
</pre></div></div>

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
	
	  
	  
	    An application of <kbd>amb</kbd>
	  
	
	    with a single choice produces an ordinary (single) value.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
	
	  
	  
	    An application of <kbd>amb</kbd>
	  
	
  with no choices—the expression <kbd>amb()</kbd>—is an
  expression with no acceptable values.  Operationally, we can think of
  <kbd>amb()</kbd> as an expression that when evaluated causes the
  computation to <QUOTE>fail</QUOTE>: The computation aborts and no value is
  produced.  Using this idea, we can express the requirement that a
  particular predicate expression <kbd>p</kbd> must be true as follows:

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_85_3_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function require(p) {
    return ! p ? amb() : "some ordinary value";      
}
</pre></div></div>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
	With <kbd>amb</kbd> and <kbd>require</kbd>, we can implement the
	
	
	<kbd>an_element_of</kbd> function
	
  used above:

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_85_4_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function an_element_of(items) {
    require(! is_null(items));
    return amb(head(items), an_element_of(tail(items));
}
</pre></div></div>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
	
	An application of <kbd>an_element_of</kbd>
	
	fails if the list is empty.  Otherwise it
  ambiguously returns either the first element of the list or an element
  chosen from the rest of the list.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
  We can also express infinite ranges of choices.  The following
  function
  potentially returns any integer greater than or equal to
  some given $n$:

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_85_5_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function an_integer_starting_from(n) {
    return amb(n, an_integer_starting_from(n + 1));
}
</pre></div></div>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
  This is like the stream
  
    
    function
    <kbd>integers_starting_from</kbd>
    
  described in section \ref{sec:infinite-streams}, but with an important
  difference: The stream
  function
  returns an object that represents the
  sequence of all integers beginning with $n$,
  whereas the <kbd>amb</kbd>
  function
  returns a single integer.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  Abstractly, we can imagine that evaluating an <kbd>amb</kbd> expression
  causes time to split into branches, where the computation continues on
  each branch with one of the possible values of the expression.  We say
  that <kbd>amb</kbd> represents a 
  
  <EM>nondeterministic choice point</EM>.
  If we had a machine with a sufficient number of processors that could
  be dynamically allocated, we could implement the search in a
  straightforward way.  Execution would proceed as in a sequential
  machine, until an <kbd>amb</kbd> expression is encountered.  At this point,
  more processors would be allocated and initialized to continue all of
  the parallel executions implied by the choice.  Each processor would
  proceed sequentially as if it were the only choice, until it either
  terminates by encountering a failure, or it further subdivides, or
  it finishes.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  On the other hand, if we have a machine that can execute
  only one process (or a few concurrent processes),
  we must consider the alternatives sequentially.
  One could imagine modifying an evaluator
  to pick at random a branch to follow whenever it encounters a choice
  point.  Random choice, however, can easily lead to failing values.
  We might try running the evaluator over and over, making random
  choices and hoping to find a non-failing value, but it is better to 
  
  <EM>
    systematically search</EM> all possible execution paths.
  The <kbd>amb</kbd> evaluator that we will develop and work with in this section
  implements a systematic search as follows: When the evaluator
  encounters an application of <kbd>amb</kbd>, it initially selects the first
  alternative.  This selection may itself lead to a further choice.  The
  evaluator will always initially choose the first alternative at each
  choice point.  If a choice results in a failure, then the evaluator
  
  automagically<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a> 
  
  <EM>backtracks</EM>
  to the most recent choice point and tries the next
  alternative.  If it runs out of alternatives at any choice point, the
  evaluator will back up to the previous choice point and resume from
  there.  This process leads to a search strategy known as 
  
  
  <EM>
    depth-first search</EM> or <EM>chronological backtracking</EM>.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-5' href='#footnote-5'>[5]</a>

  Driver loop
      </h2></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  The driver loop for the <kbd>amb</kbd> evaluator
  has some unusual properties.  It reads an
  expression and prints the value of the first non-failing execution, as
  in the
  
  example shown above.  If we
  want to see the value of the next successful execution, we can
  ask the interpreter to backtrack and attempt to generate a second
  non-failing execution.
  
    
    
  This is signaled by typing
  
  <kbd>try-again</kbd>.  If any other input except <kbd>try-again</kbd>
  is given, the interpreter will start a new problem, discarding the unexplored
  alternatives in the previous problem.
    
  
  Here is a sample
  interaction:

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_85_6_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
// Amb-Eval input:
prime_sum_pair(list(1, 3, 5, 8), list(20, 35, 110));
// Starting a new problem
// Amb-Eval value:
[3, [20, null]]

// Amb-Eval input:
try-again
// Amb-Eval value:
[3, [110, null]]

// Amb-Eval input:
try-again
// Amb-Eval value:
[8, [35, null]]

// Amb-Eval input:
try-again
// There are no more values of
prime_sum_pair([1, [3, [5, [8, null]]]], [20, [35, [110, null]]])

// Amb-Eval input:
prime_sum_pair(list(19, 27, 30), list(11, 36, 58));
// Starting a new problem
// Amb-Eval value:
[30, [11, null]]

  Write a
  
    
    function
    <kbd>an_integer_between</kbd>
    
  
that returns an integer
  between two given bounds.  This can be used to implement a
  function
  that finds Pythagorean triples,
  i.e., triples of integers $(i,j,k)$ between the given bounds such
  that $i \leq j$ and $i^2 + j^2 =k^2$, as follows:
  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_85_7_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>

    const j = an_integer_between(i, high);
    const k = an_integer_between(j, high);
    require(i * i + j * j === k * k);
    return list(i, j, k);

\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  exercise \ref{ex:stream-pythagorean-triples} discussed how to generate
  the stream of <EM>all</EM> Pythagorean triples, with no upper bound on the
  size of the integers to be searched.  Explain why simply replacing
  
    
    
      <kbd>an_integer_between</kbd>
    
  
  by
  
    
    
      <kbd>an_integer_starting_from</kbd>
    
  
  in the
  function
  in
  exercise \ref{ex:amb-pythag-triples} is not an adequate way to
  generate arbitrary Pythagorean triples.  Write a
  function
  that
  actually will accomplish this.  (That is, write a
  function
  for which
  repeatedly typing
  
    
    
      <kbd>       </kbd>
    
  
  would in principle eventually
  generate all Pythagorean triples.)

    integration of automatic search strategies
    
    into programming languages has had a long and checkered history.  The
    first suggestions that nondeterministic algorithms might be elegantly
    encoded in a programming language with search and automatic
    backtracking came from
    
    Robert Floyd (1967).  
    
    Carl Hewitt
    (1969) invented a programming language called 
    
    Planner that explicitly
    supported automatic chronological backtracking, providing for a
    built-in depth-first search strategy.  
    
    Sussman, Winograd, and Charniak 
    (1971) implemented a subset of this language, called 
    
    MicroPlanner,
    which was used to support work in problem solving and robot planning.
    Similar ideas, arising from logic and theorem proving, led to the
    genesis in Edinburgh and Marseille of the elegant language 
    
    Prolog
    (which we will discuss in section \ref{sec:logic-programming}).  After
    sufficient frustration with automatic search, 
    
    McDermott and Sussman
    (1972) developed a language called 
    
    Conniver, which included mechanisms
    for placing the search strategy under programmer control.  This proved
    unwieldy, however, and 
    
    Sussman and Stallman (1975) found a more
    tractable approach while investigating methods of symbolic analysis
    for electrical circuits.  They developed a non-chronological
    backtracking scheme that was based on tracing out the logical
    dependencies connecting facts, a technique that has come to be known
    as 
    
    <EM>dependency-directed backtracking</EM>.  Although their method was
    complex, it produced reasonably efficient programs because it did
    little redundant search.  
    
    <CITATION>Doyle 1979</CITATION> 
    and McAllester (<CITATION>McAllester 1978</CITATION>, 
    <CITATION>McAllester 1980</CITATION>)
    generalized and clarified the methods of Stallman and Sussman,
    developing a new paradigm for formulating search that is now called
    
    <EM>truth maintenance</EM>.  Modern problem-solving systems all
    use some form of truth-maintenance system as a substrate.  See 
    
    <CITATION>Forbus and deKleer 1993</CITATION> 
    for a discussion of elegant ways to build
    truth-maintenance systems and applications using truth maintenance.
    
    <CITATION>Zabih, McAllester, and Chapman 1987</CITATION> 
    describes a nondeterministic extension to Scheme that
    is based on <kbd>amb</kbd>; it is similar to the interpreter described in
    this section, but more sophisticated, because it uses
    dependency-directed backtracking rather than chronological
    
    backtracking.  <CITATION>Winston 1992</CITATION> gives an introduction to both kinds of
    backtracking.</FOOTNOTE></div>
