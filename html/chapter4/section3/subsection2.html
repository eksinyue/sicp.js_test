  Section~\ref{sec:amb-implementation} describes the implementation of
  the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$amb$} evaluator.  First, however, we give some examples of how
  it can be used.  The advantage of nondeterministic programming is that
  we can suppress the details of how search is carried out, thereby
  
  expressing our programs at a higher level of abstraction.

  The following puzzle (taken from Dinesman 1968) 
  is typical of a large class of simple logic puzzles:

  
\begin{quote}
    Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on different floors of
    an apartment house that contains only five floors.  Baker does not
    live on the top floor.  Cooper does not live on the bottom floor.
    Fletcher does not live on either the top or the bottom floor.  Miller
    lives on a higher floor than does Cooper.  Smith does not live on a
    floor adjacent to Fletcher's.  Fletcher does not live on a floor
    adjacent to Cooper's.  Where does everyone live?
  \end{quote}


  We can determine who lives on each floor in a straightforward way by
  enumerating all the possibilities and imposing the given
  restrictions:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
function multiple_dwelling() {
    const baker = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    const cooper = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    const fletcher = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    const miller = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    const smith = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    require(distinct(list(baker, cooper, fletcher, miller, smith)));
    require(! baker === 5);
    require(! cooper === 1);
    require(! fletcher === 5);
    require(! fletcher === 1);
    require(! miller > cooper);
    require(! math_abs(smith - fletcher) === 1);
    require(! math_abs(fletcher - cooper) === 1);
    return list(list("baker", baker),
                list("cooper", cooper),
                list("fletcher", fletcher),
                list("miller", miller),
                list("smith", smith));
}
\end{JavaScript}

      

  
\begin{JavaScript}
function multiple_dwelling() {
    const baker = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    const cooper = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

    const miller = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    const smith = amb(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    require(distinct(list(baker, cooper, fletcher, miller, smith)));
    require(! baker === 5);
    require(! cooper === 1);
    require(! fletcher === 5);
    require(! fletcher === 1);
    require(! miller > cooper);
    require(! math_abs(smith - fletcher) === 1);
    require(! math_abs(fletcher - cooper) === 1);
    return list(list("baker", baker),
                list("cooper", cooper),
                list("fletcher", fletcher),

\begin{Exercise}

  In the multiple dwelling problem, how many sets of assignments are
  there of people to floors, both before and after the requirement that
  floor assignments be distinct?  It is very inefficient to generate all
  possible assignments of people to floors and then leave it to
  backtracking to eliminate them.  For example, most of the restrictions
  depend on only one or two of the person-floor variables, and can thus
  be imposed before floors have been selected for all the people.
  Write and demonstrate a much more efficient
  nondeterministic
  function
  that solves this problem based upon
  generating only those possibilities that are not already ruled out by
  previous restrictions.

\begin{quote}
    Five schoolgirls sat for an examination.  Their parents—so they
    thought—showed an undue degree of interest in the result.  They
    therefore agreed that, in writing home about the examination, each 
    girl should make one true statement and one untrue one.  The following
    are the relevant passages from their letters:
    <UL>
      <LI>Betty: <QUOTE>Kitty was second in the examination.  I was only third.</QUOTE>
      </LI>
      <LI> Ethel: <QUOTE>You'll be glad to hear that I was on top.  Joan was second.</QUOTE>

      \subsubsection{
  Parsing natural language
      

      
      

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Programs designed to accept natural language as input usually start by
  attempting to <EM>parse</EM> the input, that is, to match the input
  against some grammatical structure.  For example, we might try to
  recognize simple sentences consisting of an article followed by a noun
  followed by a verb, such as <QUOTE>The cat eats.</QUOTE>  To accomplish such an
  analysis, we must be able to identify the parts of speech of
  individual words.  We could start with some lists that classify
  various words:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
const nouns = list("noun", "student", "professor", "cat", "class");

const verbs = list("verb", "studies", "lectures", "eats", "sleeps");

const articles = list("article", "the", "a");
\end{JavaScript}

      

  
\begin{JavaScript}
const nouns = list("noun", "student", "professor", "cat", "class");

const verbs = list("verb", "studies", "lectures", "eats", "sleeps");

const articles = list("article", "the", "a");
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  We also need a <EM>grammar</EM>, that is, a set of rules describing how
  grammatical elements are composed from simpler elements.  A very
  simple grammar might stipulate that a sentence always consists of two
  pieces—a noun phrase followed by a verb—and that a noun phrase
  consists of an article followed by a noun.  With this grammar, the
  sentence <QUOTE>The cat eats</QUOTE> is parsed as follows:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
["sentence", [["noun-phrase", [["article", ["the", null]], 
                               ["noun", ["cat", null]]]],
              ["verb", ["eats", null]]]]
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
  We can generate such a parse with a simple program that has separate
  functions
  for each of the grammatical rules.  To parse a sentence, we
  identify its two constituent pieces and return a list of
  these two elements, tagged with the symbol {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sentence$}:

  
  
\begin{JavaScript}
function parse_sentence() {      
    return list("sentence",
                parse_noun_phrase(),
                parse_word(verbs));
}
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
  A noun phrase, similarly, is parsed by finding an article followed by a
  noun:
  
\begin{JavaScript}
function parse_noun_phrase() {
    return list("noun-phrase",
                parse_word(articles),
                parse_word(nouns));
}
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
  At the lowest level, parsing boils down to repeatedly checking that
  the next unparsed word is a member of the list of words for the
  required part of speech.  To implement this, we maintain a global
  variable
  
    
    
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unparsed$},
    
  
  which is the input that has not yet been
  parsed.  Each time we check a word, we require that
  
    
    
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unparsed$},
    
  
  must be non-empty and that it should begin with a word from the
  designated list.  If so, we remove that word from
  
    
    
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unparsed$},
    
  
  and
  return the word together with its part of speech (which is found at
  the head of the list):<a class='superscript' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
function parse_word(word_list) {      
    require(! is_null(unparsed));
    require(member(head(unparsed), tail(word_list)) !== null);
    const found_word = head(unparsed);
    unparsed = tail(unparsed);
    return list(head(word_list), found_word);
}
\end{JavaScript}

      

  
\begin{JavaScript}
function parse_word(word_list) {      
    require(! is_null(unparsed));
    require(member(head(unparsed), tail(word_list)) !== null);
    const found_word = head(unparsed);
    unparsed = tail(unparsed);
    return list(head(word_list), found_word);
}
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
	To start the parsing, all we need to do is set
  
    
    
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$unparsed$},
    
  
	to be
  the entire input, try to parse a sentence, and check that nothing is
  left over:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
let unparsed = null;

function parse_input(input) {
    unparsed = input;
    const sent = parse_sentence();
    require(is_null(unparsed));
    return sent;
}
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
  We can now try the parser and verify that it works for our simple test
  sentence:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
// Amb-Eval input:      
parse_input(list("the",  "cat",  "eats"));
// Starting a new problem
// Amb-Eval value:
["sentence", [["noun-phrase", [["article", ["the", null]], 
                               ["noun", ["cat", null]]]],
              ["verb", ["eats", null]]]]
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
  The {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$amb$} evaluator is useful here because it is convenient to
  express the parsing constraints with the aid of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$require$}.
  Automatic search and backtracking really pay off, however, when we
  consider more complex grammars where there are choices for how the
  units can be decomposed.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Let's add to our grammar a list of prepositions:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
const prepositions = list("prep", "for", "to",  "in", "by", "with");
\end{JavaScript}


  and define a prepositional phrase (e.g., <QUOTE>for the cat</QUOTE>) to be
  a preposition followed by a noun phrase:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
function parse_prepositional_phrase() {      
    return list("prep-phrase",
                parse_word(prepositions),
                parse_noun_phrase());
}
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p14' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Now we can define a sentence to be a noun phrase followed by a verb
  phrase, where a verb phrase can be either a verb or a verb phrase
  extended by a prepositional phrase:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-5' href='#footnote-5'>[5]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
function parse_sentence() {
    return list("sentence",


}

function parse_verb_phrase() {
    function maybe_extend(verb_phrase) {
        return amb(verb_phrase,
                   maybe_extend(list("verb-phrase",
                                     verb_phrase,
                                     parse_prepositional_phrase())));
    }		   
    return maybe_extend(parse_word(verbs));
}
\end{JavaScript}

      

  
\begin{JavaScript}
function parse_sentence() {
    return list("sentence",


}

function parse_verb_phrase() {
    function maybe_extend(verb_phrase) {
        return amb(verb_phrase,
                   maybe_extend(list("verb-phrase",
                                     verb_phrase,
                                     parse_prepositional_phrase())));
    }		   
    return maybe_extend(parse_word(verbs));
}
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p15' class='permalink'></a><p>
  While we're at it, we can also elaborate the definition of noun
  phrases to permit such things as <QUOTE>a cat in the class.</QUOTE>  What we used
  to call a noun phrase, we'll now call a simple noun phrase, and a noun
  phrase will now be either a simple noun phrase or a noun phrase
  extended by a prepositional phrase:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
function parse_simple_noun_phrase() {      
    return list("simple-noun-phrase",
                parse_word(articles),
                parse_word(nouns));
}

function parse_noun_phrase() {
    function maybe_extend(noun_phrase) {
        return amb(noun_phrase,
                   maybe_extend(list("noun-phrase",
                                     noun_phrase,
                                     parse_prepositional_phrase())));
    }
    return maybe_extend(parse_simple_noun_phrase());
}
\end{JavaScript}

  
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p16' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Our new grammar lets us parse more complex sentences.  For example
  
\begin{JavaScript}
parse_input(list("the", "student", "with", "the", "cat", "sleeps", "in", "the", "class"));
\end{JavaScript}


  produces

  
\begin{JavaScript}
["sentence",
 [["noun-phrase",
  [["simple-noun-phrase", 
    [["article", ["the", null]],
     [["noun", ["student", null]],
      null],
     ["prep-phrase", 
      [["prep", ["with", null]],
       [["simple-noun-phrase",
        [["article", ["the", null]],
         [["noun", ["cat", null]]],
          null]]]]]],
     [["verb-phrase",
      [["verb", ["sleeps", null]],
       [["prep-phrase",
        [["prep", ["in", null]],
         [["simple-noun-phrase", 
          [["article", ["the", null]],
           ["noun", ["class", null]]]]]]]]]]
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p17' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Observe that a given input may have more than one legal parse.  In
  the sentence <QUOTE>The professor lectures to the student with the cat,</QUOTE>
  it may be that the professor is lecturing with the cat, or that the
  student has the cat.  Our nondeterministic program finds both
  possibilities:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
parse_input(list("the", "professor", "lectures",
                 "to", "the", "student", "with", "the", "cat"));
\end{JavaScript}


  produces

  
\begin{JavaScript}
["sentence",
 [["simple-noun-phrase", 
   [["article", ["the", null]],
    [["noun", ["professor", null]],
     null]],
    null]],
   [["verb-phrase",
    [["verb-phrase",
     [["verb", ["lectures", null]],
      [["prep-phrase",
        [["prep", ["to", null]],
         ["simple-noun-phrase", 
          [["article", ["the", null]],
           [["noun", ["student", null]],
       [["prep-phrase",
         [["prep", ["with", null]],
          ["simple-noun-phrase", 
           [["article", ["the", null]],
            [["noun", ["cat", null]]]]]]]]]]]
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p18' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Asking the evaluator to try again yields
  
\begin{JavaScript}

    [["noun", ["professor", null]],

    return amb(parse_word(verbs),      
               list("verb-phrase",
                    parse_verb_phrase(),
                    parse_prepositional_phrase()));
}
\end{JavaScript}

  Does this work?  Does the program's behavior change if we interchange
  the order of expressions in the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$amb$}?

  Extend the grammar given above to handle more complex sentences.  For
  example, you could extend noun phrases and verb phrases to include
  adjectives and adverbs, or you could handle compound sentences.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-6' href='#footnote-6'>[6]</a>

  Alyssa P. Hacker is more interested in generating interesting
  sentences than in parsing them.  She reasons that by simply changing
  the
  
    
    function
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$parse_word$}
    
  
    so that it ignores the <QUOTE>input
    sentence</QUOTE> and instead always succeeds and generates an appropriate
  word, we can use the programs we had built for parsing to do
  generation instead.  Implement Alyssa's idea, and show the first
  half-dozen or so sentences generated.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-7' href='#footnote-7'>[7]</a>

    <hr><div class='footnote'>
<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-7' href='#footnote-link-7'>[7] </a><FOOTNOTE>Our program uses the following
    function
    to determine 
    if the elements of a list are distinct:
  
\begin{JavaScript}
function distinct(items) {	
    return is_null items 
        ? true
        : is_null(tail(items))
          ? true
          : is_null(member(head(items), tail(items)))
            ? distinct(tail(items))
            : false;
}
\end{JavaScript}



  
  
    The function {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$member_equal$} is like {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$member$}
    except that it uses {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$equal$} instead
    of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$===$} to test for equality.
