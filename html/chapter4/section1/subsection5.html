  In thinking about a JavaScript program that evaluates JavaScript expressions, an
  analogy might be helpful.  One operational view of the meaning of a
  program is that a 
  
  program is a description of an abstract (perhaps
  infinitely large) machine.  For example, consider the familiar
  program to compute factorials:

  
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function factorial(n) {
    return n === 1
           ? 1
           : factorial(n - 1) * n;
}
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>

  We may regard this program as the description of a machine containing
  parts that decrement, multiply, and test for equality, together with a
  two-position switch and another factorial machine. (The factorial
  machine is infinite because it contains another factorial machine
  within it.)  Figure~\ref{fig:fact-proc-as-machine} is a flow diagram for the
  factorial machine, showing how the parts are wired together.

  In a similar way, we can regard the evaluator as a very special
  machine that takes as input a description of a machine.  Given this
  input, the evaluator configures itself to emulate the machine
  described.  For example, if we feed our evaluator the definition of
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$factorial$}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eval-factorial}, the
  evaluator will be able to compute factorials.

  From this perspective, our evaluator is seen to be a <EM>universal machine</EM>.
  It mimics other machines when these are described as 
  JavaScript 
  programs.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>

  This is striking. Try to imagine an analogous evaluator for electrical
  circuits.  This would be a circuit that takes as input a signal
  encoding the plans for some other circuit, such as a filter.  Given
  this input, the circuit evaluator would then behave like a filter with
  the same description.  Such a universal electrical circuit is
  almost unimaginably complex.  It is remarkable that the program
  evaluator is a rather simple program.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>

  Another striking aspect of the evaluator is that it acts as a bridge
  between the data objects that are manipulated by our programming
  language and the programming language itself.  Imagine that the
  evaluator program (implemented in 
  JavaScript) 
  is running, and that a user is
  typing expressions to the evaluator and observing the results.
  From
  the perspective of the user, an input expression such as 
  
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x * x$}
  is an expression in the programming language, which the evaluator
  should execute.
  
    
    
      From the perspective of the evaluator, however, the
      expression is simply a string or—after parsing—a
      tagged-object representation
      that is to be manipulated according to
      a well-defined set of rules.

  That the user's programs are the evaluator's data need not be a source
  of confusion.  In fact, it is sometimes convenient to ignore this
  distinction, and to give the user the ability to explicitly evaluate a
  string as a JavaScript expression, using JavaScript's primitive function
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$eval$}
  that takes as argument a string. It parses the string and—provided
  that it syntactically correct—evaluates the resulting representation
  in the environment in which {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$eval$} is
  applied.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>

\begin{Exercise}

  
  Given a one-argument
  function
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$p$} and an object {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$p$}
  is said to <QUOTE>halt</QUOTE> on {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$} if evaluating
  the expression
  
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$p(a)$}
  returns a value (as opposed to terminating with an error message
  or running forever).  Show that it is impossible to write a
  
  function
  
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$halts$}
  
  that correctly determines whether {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$p$}
  halts on {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$} for any
  
  function
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$p$} and object {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$}.
  Use the following
  reasoning: If you had such a
  
  function
  
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$halts$},
  
  you could implement the following program:
  
\begin{JavaScript}
function run_forever() {
    return run_forever();      
}
function try(p) {
    return halts(p, p) 
           ? run_forever();
           : "halted";
}
\end{JavaScript}

  Now consider evaluating the expression
  
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$try(try)$}
  
  and show that
  any possible outcome (either halting or running forever) violates the
  intended behavior of
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$halts$}.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-link-4'>[4] </a><FOOTNOTE>The fact that the machines are described in 
    JavaScript 
    is inessential.  If we give our evaluator a 
    JavaScript 
    program that behaves as an evaluator for
    some other language, say C, the 
    JavaScript 
    evaluator will emulate the C
    evaluator, which in turn can emulate any machine described as a C
    program.  Similarly, writing a 
    JavaScript 
    evaluator in C produces a C
    program that can execute any 
    JavaScript 
    program.  The deep idea here is that
    any evaluator can emulate any other.  Thus, the notion of <QUOTE>what can
      in principle be computed</QUOTE> (ignoring practicalities of time and
    memory required) is independent of the language or the computer, and
    instead reflects an underlying notion of 
    
    <EM>computability</EM>.  This
    was first demonstrated in a clear way by 
    
    Alan M. Turing (1912–1954),
    whose 1936 paper laid the foundations for theoretical 
    
    computer science.  In the paper, Turing presented a simple computational
    model—now known as a 
    
    <EM>Turing machine</EM>—and argued that any
    <QUOTE>effective process</QUOTE> can be formulated as a program for such a
    machine.  (This argument is known as the 
    
    <EM>Church-Turing thesis</EM>.)
    Turing then implemented a universal machine, i.e., a Turing machine
    that behaves as an evaluator for Turing-machine programs.  He used
    this framework to demonstrate that there are well-posed problems that
    cannot be computed by Turing machines (see
    exercise~\ref{ex:halting-theorem}), and so by implication cannot be
    formulated as <QUOTE>effective processes.</QUOTE>  Turing went on to make
    fundamental contributions to practical computer science as well.  For
    example, he invented the idea of 
    
    structuring programs using
    general-purpose subroutines.  See 
    
    Hodges 1983 for a biography of
    Turing.</FOOTNOTE></div><hr><div class='footnote'>
<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-link-4'>[4] </a><FOOTNOTE>Some people find it
    counterintuitive that an evaluator, which is implemented by a
    relatively simple
    function, 
    can emulate programs that are more
    complex than the evaluator itself.  The existence of a universal
    evaluator machine is a deep and wonderful property of computation.
    
    <EM>Recursion theory</EM>, a branch of mathematical logic, is concerned
    with logical limits of computation.  
    
    Douglas Hofstadter's beautiful

    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$halts$}
    
    can gain access to the
    
    function's

    This is Turing's celebrated <EM>Halting Theorem</EM>, which gave
