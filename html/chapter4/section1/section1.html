      Our evaluator for 
      JavaScript 
      will be implemented as a 
      JavaScript 
      program.  It may
      seem circular to think about evaluating 
      JavaScript 
      programs using an
      evaluator that is itself implemented in 
      JavaScript. 
      However, evaluation is a process, so it is appropriate to describe the evaluation process
      using JavaScript, 
      which, after all, is our tool for describing
      processes.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
      that it evaluates is said to be <EM>metacircular</EM>.
      
      An evaluator that is written in the same language
      
      that it evaluates is said to be <EM>metacircular</EM>.

      The metacircular evaluator is essentially a 
      JavaScript formulation of the
      environment model of evaluation described in
      section~\ref{sec:environment-model}.  Recall that the model has 
      three
      basic parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{ 
        To evaluate an operator combination,
        evaluate the subexpressions and then apply the 
        operator to the values of the 
        subexpressions.
      }
\item{ To evaluate a function application 
        combination, evaluate the function subexpression and the argument
        subexpressions, and then apply the value of
        the function subexpression to the values of the argument
        subexpressions.
      }
\item{ To apply a function to a set of arguments, evaluate the
        body of the function
        in a new environment.  To construct this
        environment, extend the environment part of the
        function object by a
        frame in which the formal parameters of the
        function are bound to the arguments to which the
        function
        is applied.

      These three rules 
      describe the essence of the evaluation process, a basic cycle in which 
      statements
      to be evaluated in environments are
      reduced to
      functions
      to be applied to arguments, which in turn are
      reduced to new 
      statements
      to be evaluated in new environments, and so
      on, until we get down to symbols, whose values are looked
      up in the environment, and to 
      operators, 
      which are applied directly (see Figure~\ref{fig:eval-apply}).<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>functions
      in the evaluator, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$eval$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$apply$},
      which are described in section~\ref{sec:core-of-evaluator}
      (see Figure~\ref{fig:eval-apply}).
    
      This evaluation cycle will be embodied by the interplay between the two
      critical
      functions
      in the evaluator, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$eval$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$apply$},
      which are described in section~\ref{sec:core-of-evaluator}
      (see Figure~\ref{fig:eval-apply}).

      The implementation of the evaluator will depend upon
      functions
      that
      define the <EM>syntax</EM> of the expressions to be evaluated.  We will
      use
      
      data abstraction to make the evaluator independent of the
      representation of the language.  For example, rather than committing
      to a choice that an assignment is to be represented by a list
      beginning with the symbol assignment we use an abstract predicate
      
	
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$is_assignment$}
      
      to test for an assignment, and we use abstract
      selectors
      
	
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$assignment_name$}
      
      and 
      
	
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$assignment_right_hand_side$}
      
      to
      access the parts of an assignment.  Implementation of expressions will
      be described in detail in section~\ref{sec:representing-expressions}.
      There are also operations, described in
      section~\ref{sec:eval-data-structures}, that specify the
      representation of
      functions
      and environments.  For example,
      
	
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_function_object$}
      
      constructs compound
      functions, 
      
	
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lookup_name_value$}
      
      accesses the values of variables, 
      and
      
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$apply_builtin_function$}
      
      
      applies a primitive
      function
      to a given list of arguments.

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-link-2'>[2] </a><FOOTNOTE>Even so, there will remain important aspects of
  the evaluation process that are not elucidated by our evaluator.  The
  most important of these are the detailed mechanisms by which
  functions
  call other
  functions
  and return values to their callers.
  We will address these issues in chapter~5, where we take a closer look
  at the evaluation process by implementing the evaluator as a simple
  register machine.</FOOTNOTE></div><hr><div class='footnote'>
<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-link-2'>[2] </a><FOOTNOTE>If we grant 
  ourselves the ability to apply primitives,
  
  then what remains for us to implement in the evaluator?  The job of
  the evaluator is not to specify the primitives of the language, but rather
  to provide the connective tissue—the means of combination and the
  means of abstraction—that binds a collection of primitives to form a
  language.  Specifically:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      The evaluator enables us to deal with nested expressions. For
      example, although simply applying primitives would suffice for evaluating
      the statement {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$1 + 6;$}, 
      it is not adequate for handling 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$1 + (2 * 3);$}.  
      As far as the primitive
      function
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$+$} is concerned,
      its arguments must be numbers, and it would choke if we passed it the
      expression {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$2 * 3$} as an argument.
      One important role of the evaluator is to choreograph
      function
      composition so that {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$2 * 3$} is reduced to 6 before being passed as an argument to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$+$}.
    
    </LI>
    <LI>The evaluator allows us to use variables.  For example, the
      primitive
      function
      for addition has no way to deal with expressions such
      as {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x + 1$}.  We need an evaluator to keep track of variables and
      obtain their values before invoking the primitive
      functions.
      
    </LI>
    <LI>The evaluator allows us to define compound
      functions.  This
      involves keeping track of
      function
      definitions, knowing how to use
      these definitions in evaluating expressions, and providing a mechanism
      that enables
      functions
      to accept arguments.
      
    </LI>
    <LI>
      The evaluator provides the
      other constructs of the language such as sequential composition and conditional expressions.
