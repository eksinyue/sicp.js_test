              To evaluate an application combination,
              the interpreter follows a similar process as for operator
	      combinations,
              which we described in
              section \ref{sec:evaluating-combinations}.
              That is, the interpreter evaluates the elements of the combination
	      and applies the function (which is the value of the
	      function expression)
	      to the arguments
              (which are the values of the argument expressions of
	      the application combination).

              In more detail, the interpreter proceeds
	      as follows when
	      evaluating application combinations:
              <UL>
                <LI>
              To evaluate an application combination of the form
              
\begin{JavaScript}
$\textit{function-expression}$ ( $\textit{argument-expressions}$ )
\end{JavaScript}

              do the following:
              
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Evaluate the function expression 
		of the application
		combination, resulting in the function to be applied.}
\item{Evaluate the argument expressions of the combination.}
\item{Apply the function to the arguments:
		<UL>
		  <LI>If the function is primitive, we simply apply the 
		  corresponding mathematical function to the arguments.
		  </LI>
		  <LI>If the function is compound, we evaluate the return
		  expression of the function with each parameter replaced
		  by the corresponding argument.
		  </LI>
		</UL>
		}
\end{enumerate}

                </LI>
              </UL>
              To illustrate this process, 
              let's evaluate the application combination
              
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
f(5);
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=4&prgrm=GYCgrAlA3EA}{\usebox\lstbox}


              Evaluating the name {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$f$}
	      results in the function declared in
              section \ref{sec:compound-procedures}.
	      Evaluating the argument expression
	      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$5$} yields the
	      argument value 5.
              Now, we retrieve the return
              expression of
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$f$}:
              
\begin{JavaScript}
sum_of_squares(a + 1, a * 2)
\end{JavaScript}

              in which we replace the parameter
	      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$}
              by the argument 5:
              
\begin{JavaScript}
sum_of_squares(5 + 1, 5 * 2)
\end{JavaScript}

              Thus the problem reduces to the evaluation of an application
	      combination with two arguments
              and a function expression
	      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sum_of_squares$}.
              Evaluating this combination involves three subproblems.
	      We must evaluate the
              function expression to get the function to be applied,
	      and we must evaluate the argument expressions to get the arguments.  
              Now {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$5 + 1$} produces 6 and
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$5 * 2$} produces 10, 
              so we must apply the
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sum_of_squares$} function 
              to 6 and 10.  
              These values are substituted
              for the parameters {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} and 
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} in the return
	      expression of 
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sum_of_squares$},
              reducing the expression to
              
\begin{JavaScript}
square(6) + square(10)
\end{JavaScript}

              If we use the declaration of
	      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$square$} once, 
              this reduces to
              
\begin{JavaScript}
(6 * 6) + square(10)
\end{JavaScript}

              which reduces by multiplication to
              
\begin{JavaScript}
36 + square(10)
\end{JavaScript}

              A second application of
	      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$square$} yields
              
\begin{JavaScript}
36 + (10 * 10)
\end{JavaScript}

	      which reduces by multiplication to
              
\begin{JavaScript}
36 + 100
\end{JavaScript}

	      and finally by addition to
              
\begin{JavaScript}
136

              The process we have just described is called the <EM>substitution

              in this chapter are concerned.  However, there are two

              <UL>
                <LI>
                  The purpose of the substitution is to help us think about
                  function
                   
                  application, not to provide a description of how
                  the interpreter really works.  Typical interpreters
		  do not evaluate
                  
		    
		    function
                    
                  applications by manipulating the text of a

                  parameters.
		  In practice, the

		  a local environment for the

		  We will discuss this more fully in chapters 3 and
                  4 when we examine the implementation of an interpreter in detail.

                  Over the course of this book, we will present a sequence of
                  increasingly elaborate models of how interpreters work,
		  culminating
                  with a complete implementation of an interpreter and compiler in
                  chapter~5.  The substitution model is only the first of
		  these modelsâ€”a way to get started thinking formally
		  about the evaluation process.  In general, when 
                  
                  modeling phenomena in science and
                  engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete models.  As we
                  examine things in greater detail, these simple models become
                  inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models.  The
                  substitution model is no exception.  In particular, when we
		  address in chapter~3 the use of 
                  functions
                   
                  with <QUOTE>mutable data,</QUOTE> we will see that
                  the substitution model breaks down and must be replaced by
		  a more complicated model of 
                  function

              According to the description of evaluation given above,
	      the interpreter first
              evaluates the function and argument expressions and then applies
	      the resulting function
              to the resulting arguments.  This is not the only way to perform
              evaluation.  An alternative evaluation model would not evaluate the
              operands until their values were needed.  Instead it would first
	      substitute argument expressions for parameters until
              it obtained an expression involving only operators, and
              would then perform the evaluation.  If we used this method, the
              evaluation of
              
\begin{JavaScript}
f(5)
\end{JavaScript}

              would proceed according to the sequence of expansions
              
\begin{JavaScript}
sum_of_squares(5 + 1, 5 * 2)
square(5 + 1)  +  square(5 * 2)
(5 + 1) * (5 + 1) + square(5 * 2)
(5 + 1) * (5 + 1) + (5 * 2) * (5 * 2)
\end{JavaScript}

              followed by the reductions
              
\begin{JavaScript}
6 * (5 + 1) + (5 * 2) * (5 * 2)
6 * 6 + (5 * 2) * (5 * 2)
36 + (5 * 2) * (5 * 2)
36 + 10 * (5 * 2)
36 + 10 * 10
36 + 100
136
\end{JavaScript}

              This gives the same answer as our previous evaluation model, but the
              process is different.  In particular, the evaluations
              of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$5 + 1$} and 
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$5 * 2$} are each performed
	      twice here,
              corresponding to the reduction of the expression
              
\begin{JavaScript}
x * x
\end{JavaScript}

              with {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} replaced respectively 
              by {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$5 + 1$} 
              and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$5 * 2$}.
