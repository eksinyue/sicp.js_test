        A powerful programming language is more than just a means for
        instructing a computer to perform tasks.  The language also serves as
        a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes.  Thus,
        when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the
        means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form
        more complex ideas.  Every powerful language has three mechanisms for
        accomplishing this:
        <UL>
          <LI>
            <B>primitive expressions</B>, which represent the simplest
            entities the language is concerned with,
            
          </LI>
          <LI>
            <B>means of combination</B>, by which compound
            elements are built from simpler ones, and
            
            
          </LI>
          <LI>
            <B>means of abstraction</B>, by
            which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.
            
          </LI>
        </UL>

            In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: 
            
            functions
            and
            
            data. (Later we will discover that they are really not so distinct.)
            Informally, data is <QUOTE>stuff</QUOTE> that we want to manipulate, and
            functions
            are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data.
            Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe
            primitive data and primitive 
            functions
            and should have methods for
            combining and abstracting 
            functions
            and data.

            In this chapter we will deal only with simple
            
            numerical data so that
            we can focus on the rules for building
            functions.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
            In later chapters we will see that
            these same rules allow us to build 
            functions
            to manipulate compound data as well.

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-link-1'>[1] </a><FOOTNOTE>The
              characterization of numbers as <QUOTE>simple data</QUOTE> 
              is a barefaced bluff.
              In fact, the treatment of numbers is one of the trickiest and most
              confusing aspects of any programming language.  Some typical issues
              involved are these:
              
              
              
              
	      <SPLIT>
	      </SPLIT>
	      How large a number can we represent?
              How many decimal places of accuracy can we represent?
	      <SPLIT></SPLIT>
              
              
              
              Above and beyond
              these questions, of course, lies a collection of issues concerning
              roundoff and truncation errorsâ€”the entire science of numerical
              analysis.  Since our focus in this book is on large-scale program
              design rather than on numerical techniques, we are going to ignore
              these problems.  The numerical examples in this chapter will exhibit
              the usual roundoff behavior that one observes when using arithmetic
              operations that preserve a limited number of decimal places of
              accuracy in noninteger operations.
