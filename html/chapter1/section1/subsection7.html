                Functions,
              as introduced above, are much like ordinary mathematical
              functions.  They specify a value that is determined by one or more
              parameters.  But there is an important difference between
              mathematical functions and computer
                functions.
                
                  
                  
                    Computer functions
                  
                
                must be effective.

              As a case in point, consider the problem of computing square
              roots.  We can define the square-root function as
              
                \[
                \sqrt{x} =\text{ the }y\text{ such that }y \geq 0\text{ and }
                y^2 = x
                \]
              
              This describes a perfectly legitimate mathematical function.  We could
              use it to recognize whether one number is the square root of another, or
              to derive facts about square roots in general.  On the other hand, the
              definition does not describe a
              computer function.
                Indeed, it tells us almost
              nothing about how to actually find the square root of a given number.  It
              will not help matters to rephrase this definition in pseudo-JavaScript:
                
\begin{JavaScript}
function sqrt(x) {
    return the y with y >= 0 &&
                      square(y) === x;
}
\end{JavaScript}

              This only begs the question.

              The contrast between
                
                  
                  
                    mathematical function and computer function
                  
                
              is a reflection of the
              general distinction between describing properties of things and
              describing how to do things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the
              distinction between
              
              
              declarative knowledge and imperative knowledge.
              In
              
              
              mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative (what is)
              descriptions, whereas in computer science we are usually concerned
              with imperative (how to) descriptions.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>

          How does one compute square roots?  The most common way is to use
          Newton's method of successive approximations, which says that whenever
          we have a guess $y$ for the value of the square root of a
          number $x$,
          we can perform a simple manipulation to get a better guess (one closer
          to the actual square root) by averaging $y$ with
          $x/y$.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>~1:

\maxsizebox{\linewidth}{0.8\paperheight}{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{{img\string_tex/ch1\string_1\string_7-1}.png}}
\end{figure}

          
          Continuing this process, we obtain better and better
          approximations to the square root.
        
          For example, we can compute
          the square root of 2 as follows.  Suppose our initial guess is~1:
          
            
\begin{figure}[H]

\maxsizebox{\linewidth}{0.8\paperheight}{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{{img\string_tex/ch1\string_1\string_7-1}.png}}
\end{figure}

          
          Continuing this process, we obtain better and better
          approximations to the square root.

              Now let's formalize the process in terms of functions.  We start with
              a value for the
              
              radicand (the number whose square root we are trying
              to compute) and a value for the guess.  If the guess is good enough
              for our purposes, we are done; if not, we must repeat the process with an
              improved guess.  We write this basic strategy as a
                
                  
                  
                   function:

              The {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sqrt$} program also illustrates that the simple functional
              language we have introduced so far is sufficient for writing any
              purely numerical program that one could write in, say, C or
              Pascal.  This might seem surprising, since we have not
              yet introduced
              any iterative
              
              (looping) constructs that direct the
              computer to do something over and over again. The function
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sqrt_iter$}, on the
              other hand, demonstrates how iteration can be accomplished using no
              special construct other than the ordinary ability to call a

\begin{Answer}[ref={ex:unlabeled2}]

		  Any call of
		  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sqrt_iter$}
		  leads immediately to an infinite loop. The reason
		  for this is our applicative-order evaluation. The
		  evaluation of the return expression of
		  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sqrt_iter$}
		  needs to evaluate its arguments first, including
		  the recursive call of
		  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sqrt_iter$},
		  regardless whether the predicate evaluates to
		  <EM>true</EM> or <EM>false</EM>. The same of course
		  happens with the recursive call, and thus the

\begin{Answer}[ref={ex:ex-sqrt-end-test}]

      The absolute tolerance of 0.001 is too large when computing the square
      root of a small value.
      For example, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sqrt(0.0001)$}
      results in 0.03230844833048122 instead of the expected value 0.01,
      an error of over 200%.
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p></p></div>
      On the other hand, for very large values, rounding errors might make
      the algorithm fail to ever get close enough to the square root, in which
      case it will not terminate terminates. 
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p></p></div>

      tolerance with a relative tolerance.

\begin{Exercise}

                
                
                Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if
                $y$ is an
                approximation to the cube root of $x$, then a better approximation is
                given by the value
                
                    \[ \frac{x/y^{2}+2y} {3} \]
                
                Use this formula to implement a cube-root
                
                  
                  
                    function
                  
                
                analogous to the
                square-root
                function.
                (In section~\ref{sec:proc-returned-values} we
                will see how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction
                of these square-root and cube-root
                functions.)

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-link-3'>[3] </a><FOOTNOTE>Declarative and
                imperative descriptions are intimately related, as indeed are
                mathematics and computer science.  For instance, to say that the
                answer produced by a program is
                
                <QUOTE>correct</QUOTE> is to make a declarative
                statement about the program.  There is a large amount of research
                aimed at establishing techniques for
                
                proving that programs are
                correct, and much of the technical difficulty of this subject has to
                do with negotiating the transition between imperative statements (from
                which programs are constructed) and declarative statements (which can
                be used to deduce things).  In a related vein, an important current
                area in programming-language design is the exploration of so-called
                
                
                very high-level languages, in which one actually programs in terms of
                declarative statements.  The idea is to make interpreters
                sophisticated enough so that, given <QUOTE>what is</QUOTE> knowledge
                specified by
                the programmer, they can generate <QUOTE>how to</QUOTE> knowledge automatically.
                This cannot be done in general, but there are important areas where
                progress has been made.  We shall revisit this idea in chapter~4.</FOOTNOTE></div><hr><div class='footnote'>
