              One of our goals in this chapter is to isolate issues about process
              descriptions.  As a case in point, let us consider that, in evaluating
              operator combinations, the interpreter proceeds as follows.
              <UL>
                <LI>To evaluate an operator combination, do the following:
                  
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Evaluate the operand expressions of the combination.}
\item{Apply the function that is denoted by
                      the operator to the arguments that are the values of
                      the operands.
                    }
\end{enumerate}

                </LI>
              </UL>
              Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about
              processes in general. First, observe that the first step dictates
              that in order to accomplish the evaluation process for an operator
              expression
              we must first perform the evaluation process on each operand of the
              operator combination.  Thus, the evaluation rule is
              
              <EM>recursive</EM> in nature;
              that is, it includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule
              itself.

              Notice how succinctly the idea of recursion can be used to express
              what, in the case of a deeply nested combination, would otherwise be
              viewed as a rather complicated process.  For example, evaluating
              
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
(2 + 4 * 6) * (3 + 12);
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

              requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different
              combinations.  We can obtain a picture of this process by
              
              representing
              the combination in the form of a
              
              tree, as shown in
              Figure \ref{fig:tree-comb-javascript}.
              Each combination is represented by a
              
              node with
              
              branches corresponding to the operator and the
              operands of the operator combination stemming from it.
              The
              
              terminal nodes (that is, nodes with
              no branches stemming from them) represent either operators or numbers.
              Viewing evaluation in terms of the tree, we can imagine that the
              values of the operands percolate upward, starting from the terminal
              nodes and then combining at higher and higher levels.  In general, we
              shall see that recursion is a very powerful technique for dealing with
              hierarchical, treelike objects.  In fact, the <QUOTE>percolate values
                upward</QUOTE> form of the evaluation rule is an example of a general kind
              of process known as
              
              <EM>tree accumulation</EM>.

              Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings
              us to the point where we need to evaluate, not operator combinations, but
              primitive expressions such as numerals or
              names.  We take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that

              Notice the role of the
              
              environment in determining the meaning of
              the names in expressions.  In
              JavaScript, it is meaningless to speak of the value of an expression such as
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x + 1$}
              without specifying any information about the environment
              that would provide a meaning for the
              name {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}.
              As we shall see in chapter 3, the general notion of
              the environment as providing a context in which evaluation takes place
              will play an important role in our understanding of program execution.

              Notice that the
              evaluation rule given above does not handle constant declarations.
              For instance, evaluating
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$const x = 3;$}
              does not apply the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$=$}
              operator to two arguments, one
              of which is the value of the name
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} and the other of which is
              3, since the purpose of the constant declaration
              is precisely to associate
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} with a value.
              (That is, the part {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x = 3$}
              in the constant declaration
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$const x = 3;$}
              is not an operator combination.)

              The string <QUOTE>{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$const$}</QUOTE>
              in the constant declaration is rendered in bold letters to indicate that it
              is a <EM>keyword</EM> in JavaScript. Keywords are reserved words that
              carry a particular meaning, and thus cannot be used as names.
              A keyword or a combination of keywords instructs the
              JavaScript interpreter to treat the respective statement in a special
              way.
              Each such syntactic form
              has its own evaluation rule. The various kinds of statements (each
              with its associated evaluation rule) constitute the
              
              syntax of the
              programming language.
