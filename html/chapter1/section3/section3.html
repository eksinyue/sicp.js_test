        We have seen that
        functions
        are, in effect, abstractions that describe
        compound operations on numbers independent of the particular numbers.
        For example, when we
	
	  declare
	
        <div class='snippet' id='javascript_17_1_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint' title='Evaluate Javascript expression'
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function cube(x) {
    return x * x * x;
}
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=1&prgrm=GYVwdgxgLglg9mABBEAjApgCgB4EpEDeAUIqYgE7pQjlLaIBUi9T2A3EQL5FEoaYBmXGyA}{\usebox\lstbox}
</pre>

</div></div>

        
        
        we are not talking about the cube of a particular number, but rather
        about a method for obtaining the cube of any number.  Of course we
        could get along without ever 
        
	declaring this function,
	by always writing expressions such as
        <div class='snippet' id='javascript_17_2_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
3 * 3 * 3;
x * x * x;
y * y * y;
</pre></div></div>
        and never mentioning <kbd>cube</kbd> explicitly.  
        This would place us at a
        serious disadvantage, forcing us to work always at the level of the
        particular operations that happen to be primitives in the language
        (multiplication, in this case) rather than in terms of higher-level
        operations.  Our programs would be able to compute cubes, but our
        language would lack the ability to express the concept of cubing.  One
        of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is
        the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common
        patterns and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly.
        Functions
        provide this ability.  This is why all but the most
        primitive programming languages include mechanisms for 
        
	declaring functions.

        Yet even in numerical processing we will be severely limited in our
        ability to create abstractions if we are restricted to
        functions
        whose parameters must be numbers.  Often the same programming pattern
        will be used with a number of different
        functions.  To express such
        patterns as concepts, we will need to construct
        functions
        that can
        accept
        functions
        as arguments or return
        functions
        as values.
        Functions
        that manipulate
        functions
        are called 
        
        <EM>higher-order
          functions</EM>.  This section shows how higher-order
        functions
        can serve
        as powerful abstraction mechanisms, vastly increasing the expressive
        power of our language.
