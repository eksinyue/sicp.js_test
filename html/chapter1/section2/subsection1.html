              We begin by considering the factorial function, defined by
              
              \[ n!=n\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdots3\cdot2\cdot1 \]
              
              There are many ways to compute factorials.  One way is to make use of
              the observation that $n!$ is equal to 
              $n$ times $(n-1)!$ for
              any positive integer~$n$:
              
              \[ n!=n\cdot\left[(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdots3\cdot2\cdot1\right]=n\cdot(n-1)! \]
              
              Thus, we can compute $n!$ by computing 
              $(n-1)!$ and multiplying the
              result by $n$.  If we add the stipulation that 1! 
              is equal to 1,
              this observation translates directly into a 
              function:
              
              
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}

           : n * factorial(n - 1);

              Now let's take a different perspective on computing factorials.  We
              could describe a rule for computing $n!$ by 
              specifying that we
              first multiply 1 by 2, then multiply the result by 3, then by 4,
              and so on until we reach $n$.
              More formally, we maintain a running product, together with a counter
              that counts from 1 up to $n$.  We can describe the computation by
              saying that the counter and the product simultaneously change from one
              step to the next according to the rule

              <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
              product $\leftarrow$ counter $\cdot$ product

              <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
              counter $\leftarrow$ counter $+$ 1
              </p></div>
              and stipulating that $n!$ is the value of the product when
              the counter exceeds $n$.

          Compare the two processes.  From one point of view, they seem hardly
          different at all.  Both compute the same mathematical function on the
          same domain, and each requires a number of steps proportional to $n$
          to compute $n!$.  Indeed, both processes even carry out the same
          sequence of multiplications, obtaining the same sequence of partial
          products.  On the other hand, when we consider the
          
          <QUOTE>shapes</QUOTE> of the
          two processes, we find that they evolve quite differently.
        </p></div>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
          Consider the first process.  The substitution model reveals a shape of
          expansion followed by contraction, indicated by the arrow in
          figure~\ref{fig:recursive-factorial}.  The expansion occurs as the
          process builds up a chain of 
          
          <EM>deferred operations</EM> (in this case,
          a chain of multiplications).  The contraction occurs as 
          the operations are
          actually performed.  This type of process, characterized by a chain of
          deferred operations, is called a 
          
          <EM>recursive process</EM>.  Carrying
          out this process requires that the interpreter keep track of the
          operations to be performed later on.  In the computation of $n!$,
          the length of the chain of deferred multiplications, and hence the amount
          of information needed to keep track of it, 
          
          grows linearly with $n$
          (is proportional to $n$), just like the number of steps.
          
          
          
          Such a process is called a <EM>linear recursive process</EM>.
        </p></div>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
          By contrast, the second process does not grow and shrink.  At each
          step, all we need to keep track of, for any $n$, are the current
          values of the
	  names
	  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$product$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$counter$}, and 
          {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$max_count$}.  We call this an 
          
          <EM>iterative process</EM>.  In general, an
          iterative process is one whose state can be summarized by
	  
	    
	    
	      the values of a fixed
              number of
              
            <EM>state names</EM>,
	    
	  
	  together with a fixed rule that
          describes how
	  
	    
	    
	      the values of the state names
	    
	  
	  should be updated as the process
          moves from state to state and an (optional) end test that specifies
          conditions under which the process should terminate.  In computing
          $n!$, the number of steps required grows linearly with $n$.  Such a process is
          called a 
          
          
          
          <EM>linear iterative process</EM>.
        </p></div>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
              The contrast between the two processes can be seen in another way.  In
              the iterative case, the
	      
		
		
		  values of the state names
		
	      
	      provide a complete
              description of the state of the process at any point.  If we stopped
              the computation between steps, all we would need to do to resume the
              computation is to supply the interpreter with the values of the three
	      
		
		
		  state names.
		
	      
		  Not so with the recursive process.  In this case
              there is some additional <QUOTE>hidden</QUOTE> information, maintained by the
              interpreter and not contained in the
	      
		
		
		  state names,
		
	      
		  which
              indicates <QUOTE>where the process is</QUOTE> in negotiating the chain of
              deferred operations.  The longer the chain, the more information must
              be maintained.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
              In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to
              confuse the notion of a 
              
              
              recursive <EM>process</EM> with the notion of a
              recursive 
              <EM>function</EM>.  
              When we describe a function as recursive,
              we are referring to the syntactic fact that the
	      
	      function declaration 
              refers (either directly or indirectly) to the function itself.  But
              when we describe a process as following a pattern that is, say,
              linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not
              about the syntax of how a function is written.  It may seem
              disturbing that we refer to a recursive function such as 
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fact_iter$}
              as generating an iterative process.  However, the process
              really is iterative: Its state is captured completely by its three
              state names,
	      and an interpreter need keep track of only three
	      names
	      in order to execute the process.
        </p></div>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
              One reason that the distinction between process and procedure may be
              confusing is that most implementations of common languages (including
              
              
              
              Ada, Pascal, and C) are designed in such a way that the
              interpretation of any recursive function consumes an amount of memory
              that grows with the number of function calls, even when the process
              described is, in principle, iterative.  As a consequence, these
              languages can describe iterative processes only by resorting to
              special-purpose 
              
              <QUOTE>looping constructs</QUOTE> such as {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$do$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$repeat$},
              {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$until$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$for$}, and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$while$}.  The implementation of
	      JavaScript
              we shall consider in chapter~5 does not share this defect.  It will
              execute an iterative process in constant space, even if the iterative
              process is described by a recursive function.  An implementation with
              this property is called 
              
              <EM>tail-recursive</EM>.  With a tail-recursive
              implementation, 
              
              iteration can be expressed using the ordinary
              function call mechanism, so that special iteration constructs are
              useful only as 
              
              syntactic sugar.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>

        Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by
        the functions {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$f$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$g$}, and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$h$} for positive integer
        values of $n$.  For example,
	$k(n)$ computes $5n^2$.

\begin{Answer}[ref={ex:unlabeled3}]

      The function $f(n)$ computes
      $2 n$,
      the function $g(n)$ computes
      $2^n$, and
      the function $h(n)$ computes
      $2^{2^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^2}}}}$
      where the number of 2s in
      the chain of exponentiation is $n$.

                has a fixed set of registers and no auxiliary memory.  In contrast,
                realizing a recursive process requires a machine that uses an

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-link-3'>[3] </a><FOOTNOTE>Tail recursion has long been
                
                known as a compiler optimization trick.  A coherent semantic basis for
                tail recursion was provided by Carl Hewitt (1977), who explained it in
                
                terms of the <QUOTE>message-passing</QUOTE> model of computation that we shall
                discuss in chapter~3. Inspired by this, Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy
                Lewis Steele Jr.~(see Steele 1975) 
                constructed a tail-recursive
                interpreter for Scheme.  Steele later showed how tail recursion is a
                consequence of the natural way to compile 
                function 
                calls (Steele 1977).
		The IEEE standard for Scheme requires that Scheme implementations
                
                be tail-recursive. The ECMA standard for JavaScript eventually followed
		suit with ECMAScript 2015 (ECMA 2015). Note however,
		that as of this writing (2019), most implementations of JavaScript do
		not comply with this standard.
