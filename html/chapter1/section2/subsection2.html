          Another common pattern of computation is called <EM>tree recursion</EM>.
          As an example, consider computing the sequence of
          
          Fibonacci numbers,
          in which each number is the sum of the preceding two: 
          
          \[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \ldots \]
          
          In general, the Fibonacci numbers can be defined by the rule
          
\begin{eqnarray*}
          \textrm{Fib}(n) & = & \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
          0   &  \mbox{if }\\
          1   &  \mbox{if }\\
          \textrm{Fib}(n-1)+\textrm{Fib}(n-2) & \mbox{otherwise}
          \end{array}
          \right.
\end{eqnarray*}

              We can immediately translate this definition into a recursive

\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}

    return n === 0

          Consider the pattern of this computation.  To compute
          
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib(5)$}
          ,
          we compute
          
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib(4)$}
          
            and

            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib(3)$}

            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib(2)$}
          .  In general, the evolved
          process looks like a tree, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:fib-tree}.
          Notice that the branches split into two at each level (except at the
          bottom); this reflects the fact that the
          {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib$}
          function
          calls itself twice each time it is invoked.

          This
          function
          is instructive as a prototypical tree recursion, but it
          is a terrible way to compute Fibonacci numbers because it does so much
          redundant computation.  Notice in figure~\ref{fig:fib-tree} that
          the entire computation of
          {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib(3)$}—almost half the work—is
          duplicated.  In fact, it is not hard to show that the number of times
          the function will compute {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib(1)$} or {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib(0)$} (the number
          of leaves in the above tree, in general) is precisely $\textrm{Fib}(n+1)$.  To get an idea of how bad this is, one can show that the
          value of $\textrm{Fib}(n)$
          
          grows exponentially with $n$.  More precisely
          (see exercise~\ref{ex:fib-proof}),
          $\textrm{Fib}(n)$ is the closest
          integer to $\phi^{n} /\sqrt{5}$, where
          
              \[ \phi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2\approx 1.6180 \]
          
          is the
              
              <EM>golden ratio</EM>, which satisfies the equation
              
              \[ \phi^{2} =\phi + 1 \]
              
              Thus, the process uses a number of steps that grows exponentially
              with the input.  On the other hand, the space required grows only
              linearly with the input, because we need keep track only of which
              nodes are above us in the tree at any point in the computation.  In
              general, the number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be
              proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, while the space
              required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.
        </p></div>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
              We can also formulate an iterative process for computing the
              Fibonacci numbers.  The idea is to use a pair of integers $a$ and
              $b$,
              initialized to $\textrm{Fib}(1)=1$ and $\textrm{Fib}(0)=0$,
              and to repeatedly apply the simultaneous
              transformations
              
              \begin{eqnarray*}
              a & \leftarrow & a+b \\
              b & \leftarrow & a
              \end{eqnarray*}
              
              It is not hard to show that, after applying this transformation $n$
              times, $a$ and $b$
              will be equal, respectively, to $\textrm{Fib}(n+1)$ and
              $\textrm{Fib}(n)$.  Thus, we can compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively using
              the function

              

        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function fib(n) {
    return fib_iter(1, 0, n);
}
function fib_iter(a, b, count) {
    return count === 0
           ? b
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}

           : fib_iter(a + b, a, count - 1);
}

\end{JavaScriptClickable}



              This second method for computing $\textrm{Fib}(n)$ is a linear iteration.  The
              difference in number of steps required by the two methods—one linear in $n$,
              one growing as fast as $\textrm{Fib}(n)$ itself—is enormous, even for
              small inputs.

              One should not conclude from this that tree-recursive processes are
              useless.  When we consider processes that operate on hierarchically
              structured data rather than numbers, we will find that tree recursion
              is a natural and powerful tool.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$fib$}

         But even in numerical operations,
              tree-recursive processes can be useful in helping us to understand and
              design programs.  For instance, although the first

              function
              is much less efficient than the second one, it is more

        \subsubsection{
          Example: Counting change
        
        

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
              It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative
              Fibonacci algorithm.  In contrast, consider the
              following problem: How many different ways can we make change of $\$ 1.00$,
              given half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies?  More
              generally, can we write a
              function
              to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of money?
        </p></div>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
              This problem has a simple solution as a recursive
              function.  Suppose
              we think of the types of coins available as arranged in some order.
              Then the following relation holds:

              The number of ways to change amount $a$ using $n$ kinds of coins equals

              <UL>
                <LI>
                  the number of ways to change amount $a$ using all but the first
              kind of coin, plus
                </LI>
                <LI>
              the number of ways to change amount $a-d$ using all $n$ kinds of
              coins, where $d$ is the denomination of the first kind of coin.
                </LI>
              </UL>
        </p></div>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
          To see why this is true, observe that the ways to make change can be
          divided into two groups: those that do not use any of the first kind
          of coin, and those that do.  Therefore, the total number of ways to
          make change for some amount is equal to the number of ways to make
          change for the amount without using any of the first kind of coin,
          plus the number of ways to make change assuming that we do use the
          first kind of coin.  But the latter number is equal to the number of
          ways to make change for the amount that remains after using a coin of
          the first kind.
        </p></div>

        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
          Thus, we can recursively reduce the problem of changing a given amount
          to problems of changing smaller amounts or using fewer kinds of coins.
          Consider this reduction rule carefully, and convince yourself that we
          can use it to describe an algorithm if we specify the following
          degenerate cases:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a><UL>
            <LI>
              If $a$ is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.
            </LI>
            <LI>
              If $a$ is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.
            </LI>
            <LI> If $n$ is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.
            </LI>
          </UL>
        

          <UL>
            <LI>
              If $a$ is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.
            </LI>
            <LI>
              If $a$ is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.
            </LI>
            <LI> If $n$ is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.

\label{ex:unlabeled7}

                
                The following pattern of numbers is called
                <EM>Pascal's triangle</EM>.
                
                \[
                {
                \begin{array}{rrrrrrrrr}
                &   &   &   & 1 &   &   &   &     \\
                &   &   &1  &   &1  &   &   &     \\
                &   &1  &   & 2 &   &1  &   &     \\
                &1  &   &3  &   &3  &   &1  &     \\
                1  &   & 4 &   & 6 &   & 4 &   & 1   \\
                &   &   &   & \ldots & & & & 
                \end{array}}
                \]
                
                The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and
                each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers
                above it.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>function that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means
                of a recursive process.

        
        
                Write a function that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means
                of a recursive process.

\begin{Exercise}

                Prove that $\textrm{Fib}(n)$ is the closest integer to $\phi^n/\sqrt{5}$,
                where $\phi= (1+\sqrt{5})/2$.  Hint: Let $\psi= (1-\sqrt{5})/2$.  Use
                induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see
                section~\ref{sec:tree-recursion}) to prove that $\textrm{Fib}(n)=(\phi^n
                  -\psi^n)/\sqrt{5}$.

                at in section~\ref{sec:evaluating-combinations}:

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-link-4'>[4] </a><FOOTNOTE>One
            approach to coping with redundant computations is to arrange matters
            so that we automatically construct a table of values as they
            are computed.  Each time we are asked to apply the
            function
            to some argument, we first look to see if the value is already stored in the
            table, in which case we avoid performing the redundant computation.
            This strategy, known as
            
            <EM>tabulation</EM> or <EM>memoization</EM>, can be
            implemented in a straightforward way.  Tabulation can sometimes be
            used to transform processes that require an exponential number of
            steps (such as {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$count-change$})
            into processes whose space and time
            requirements grow linearly with the input.  See
            exercise~\ref{ex:memoization}.</FOOTNOTE></div><hr><div class='footnote'>
<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-link-4'>[4] </a><FOOTNOTE>The elements of Pascal's triangle are
                  called the <EM>binomial coefficients</EM>, because the
                  $n$th row consists of
                  
                  the coefficients of the terms in the
                  expansion of $(x+y)^n$.  This
                  pattern for computing the coefficients
                  
                  appeared in Blaise Pascal's 1653 seminal work on
                  probability theory,

                  Knuth (1973), the same pattern appears in the <EM>Szu-yuen

                  by the Chinese mathematician Chu Shih-chieh in 1303, in the
                  works of the twelfth-century Persian poet and mathematician Omar
                  Khayyam, and in the works of the twelfth-century Hindu mathematician
                  Bháscara Áchárya.</FOOTNOTE></div>
