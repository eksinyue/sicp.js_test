    The <kbd>integral</kbd>
    function
    at the end of the preceding section shows
    how we can use streams to model signal-processing systems that contain
    
    feedback loops.  The feedback loop for the adder shown in
    figure \ref{fig:integral} is modeled by the fact that <kbd>integral</kbd>'s
    
    internal stream <kbd>int</kbd> is defined in terms of itself:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_69_1_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
const integ = pair(initial_value, 
    () => add_streams(scale_stream(integrand, dt),
                      integ);
        );
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <SPLIT>
    
    
      The interpreter's ability to deal with such an implicit definition
      depends on the delay resulting from wrapping the call of
      <kbd>add_streams</kbd> into a function definition.
      Without this delay, the interpreter could not
      construct <kbd>integ</kbd> before evaluating both
      arguments to <kbd>pair</kbd>, which would require
      that <kbd>integ</kbd> already be defined.
      In general, such a delay is crucial for using streams to model
      signal-processing systems that contain loops.  Without a delay,
      our models would have to be formulated so that the inputs to any
      signal-processing component would be fully evaluated before the output
      could be produced.  This would outlaw loops.

	Unfortunately, stream models of systems with loops
	may require uses of a delay beyond the stream programming pattern seen so far.
	For instance,
	figure \ref{fig:analog-computer} shows a signal-processing system for
	solving the 
	
	differential equation $dy/dt=f(y)$ where $f$ is a given
	function.  The figure shows a mapping component, which
	applies $f$ to its input signal, linked in a feedback loop to an
	integrator in a manner very similar to that of the analog computer
	circuits that are actually used to solve such equations.

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Assuming we are given an initial value $y_0$ for $y$, we
    could try to model this system using the
    function

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_69_2_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function solve(f, y0, dt) {
    const y = integral(dy, y0, dt);
    const dy = stream_map(f, y);
    return y;
}
</pre></div></div>
    This
    function
    does not work, because in the first line of <kbd>solve</kbd>
    the call to <kbd>integral</kbd> requires that the input <kbd>dy</kbd> be
    defined, which does not happen until the second line of <kbd>solve</kbd>.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
    On the other hand, the intent of our definition does make sense,
    because we can, in principle, begin to generate the <kbd>y</kbd> stream
    without knowing <kbd>dy</kbd>.
    
      
      
	Indeed, <kbd>integral</kbd> and many other
	stream operations can generate part of the answer given only
	partial information about the arguments.
      
    
    For <kbd>integral</kbd>, the
    first element of the output stream is the specified <kbd>initial_value</kbd>.  Thus, we can generate the first element of the output
    stream without evaluating the integrand <kbd>dy</kbd>.  Once we know the
    first element of <kbd>y</kbd>, the
    
      
      
	<kbd>stream_map</kbd>
      
    
    in the second line of
    <kbd>solve</kbd> can begin working to generate the first element of <kbd>dy</kbd>, which will produce the next element of <kbd>y</kbd>, and so on.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
    To take advantage of this idea, we will redefine <kbd>integral</kbd> to
    expect the integrand stream to be a 
    
    
    
    <EM>delayed argument</EM>.
    
      
      
	The function <kbd>integral</kbd> will force
      
    
    the integrand to be evaluated only when it
    is required to generate more than the first element of the output stream:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_69_3_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function integral(delayed_integrand, intial_value, dt) {
    const integrand = delayed_integrand();
    const integ =      
        pair(intial_value,
            add_streams(scale_stream(integrand, dt), int));
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Now we can implement our <kbd>solve</kbd>
    function
    by delaying the
    evaluation of <kbd>dy</kbd> in the definition of <kbd>y</kbd>:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_69_4_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function solve(f, y0, dt) {
    const y = integral( () => dy, y0, dt);
    const dy = stream_map(f, y);
    return y;
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>
  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
    In general, every caller of <kbd>integral</kbd> must now
    delay
    the integrand argument.  We can demonstrate that the <kbd>solve</kbd>
    function
    works by approximating 
    
    $e\approx 2.718$ by computing the value at
    $y=1$ of the solution to the differential equation $dy/dt=y$ with
    initial condition $y(0)=1$:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_69_5_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
stream_ref(solve(y => y, 1, 0.001), 1000);
</pre></div></div>

    The <kbd>integral</kbd>

    used above was analogous to the
    <QUOTE>implicit</QUOTE> definition of the infinite stream of integers in

      has the same problem
      as does our original version of <kbd>integral</kbd>.  Modify the
      function
      so that it expects the <kbd>integrand</kbd> as a delayed argument and hence

    Consider the problem of designing a signal-processing system to study
    the homogeneous second-order linear differential equation
    
      \[ \frac {d^{2} y}{dt^{2}}-a\frac{dy}{dt}-by=0 \]
    
    The output stream, modeling $y$, is generated by a network that
    contains a loop. This is because the value of $d^{2}y/dt^{2}$ depends
    upon the values of $y$ and $dy/dt$ and both of these are determined by
    integrating $d^{2}y/dt^{2}$.  The diagram we would like to encode is
    shown in Figure \ref{fig:2nd-order}.  Write a
    function <kbd>solve_2nd</kbd>
    that
    takes as arguments the constants $a$, $b$, and $dt$ and the initial
    values $y_{0}$ and $dy_{0}$ for $y$ and $dy/dt$ and generates the
    stream of successive values of $y$.

\begin{Exercise}

    
    
    
    A <EM>series RLC circuit</EM> consists of a resistor, a capacitor, and an
    inductor connected in series, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:series-rlc}.
    If $R$, $L$, and $C$ are the resistance, inductance, and capacitance,
    then the relations between voltage ($v$) and current ($i$)
    for the three components are described by the equations
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    v_{R} &=& i_{R} R\\
    v_{L} &=& L\frac{di_{L}}{dt}\\
    i_{C} &=& C\frac{dv_{C}}{dt}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    and the circuit connections dictate the relations
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    i_{R} &=& i_{L}=-i_{C}\\
    v_{C} &=& v_{L}+v_{R}
    \end{eqnarray*}

    Combining these equations shows that the state of the circuit
    (summarized by $v_{C}$, the voltage across the capacitor, and $i_{L}$, the
    current in the inductor)
    is described by the pair of differential equations
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \frac{dv_{C}}{dt} &=& -\frac{i_{L}}{C}\\
    \frac {di_{L}}{dt} &=& \frac{1}{L}v_{C}-\frac{R}{L}i_{L}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    The signal-flow diagram representing this system of differential
    equations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rlc-signal-flow}.

    The examples in this section illustrate how
    
      
      delayed evaluation
    
    provides great programming flexibility, but the
    same examples also show how this can make our programs more complex.
    Our new <kbd>integral</kbd>
    function,
    for instance, gives us the power to
    model systems with loops, but we must now remember that
    <kbd>integral</kbd>
    should be called with a delayed integrand, and every
    function
    that  uses <kbd>integral</kbd> must be aware of this.  In effect,
    we have created two classes of
    functions:
    ordinary
    functions
    and
    functions
    that
    take delayed arguments.  In general, creating separate classes of
    functions
    forces us to create separate classes of higher-order
    functions
    as well.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
    One way to avoid the need for two different classes of
    functions
    is to make all
    functions
    take delayed arguments.  We could adopt a model of evaluation in which all arguments to
    functions
    are automatically delayed and arguments are forced only when they are actually needed
    (for example, when they are required by a primitive operation).  This
    would transform our language to use normal-order evaluation, which we
    first described when we introduced the substitution model for
    evaluation in section \ref{sec:substitution-model}.  Converting to
    normal-order evaluation provides a uniform and elegant way to simplify
    the use of delayed evaluation, and this would be a natural strategy to
    adopt if we were concerned only with stream processing.  In
    section \ref{sec:lazy-evaluation}, after we have studied the evaluator,
    we will see how to transform our language in just this way.
    Unfortunately, including delays in
    function
    calls wreaks havoc with
    our ability to design programs that depend on the order of events,
    such as programs that use assignment, mutate data, or perform input or output.
    
      
      
	Even a single delay in the tail of a pair can cause
	great confusion, as illustrated by exercise \ref{ex:delayed1}
	and \ref{ex:delayed2}.
      
    
    As far as anyone knows, mutability and delayed
    evaluation do not mix well in programming languages, and devising ways
    to deal with both of these at once is an active area of research.

<hr><div class='footnote'>
<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-link-1'>[1] </a><FOOTNOTE>This is a small reflection, in
    JavaScript,
    of the difficulties that conventional strongly typed languages such as 
    
    
    
    
    
    Pascal have in coping with higher-order
    functions.
    In such languages, the programmer must specify the data types of the arguments and the
    result of each
    function:
    number, logical value, sequence, and so on.
    Consequently, we could not express an abstraction such as <QUOTE>map a given
    function
    
      
      <kbd>fun</kbd>
    
    over all the elements in a sequence</QUOTE> by a single higher-order
    function
    such as
    
      
      <kbd>stream_map</kbd>.
    
    Rather, we would need a different mapping
    function
    for each different combination of argument and result data types that might be specified
    for a
    
      
      <kbd>fun</kbd>.
    
    Maintaining a practical notion of
    <QUOTE>data type</QUOTE> in the presence of higher-order
    functions
    raises many difficult issues.
    One way of dealing with this problem is illustrated by the language ML
    
    
    
    
    (<CITATION>Gordon, Milner, and Wadsworth 1979</CITATION>), 
    whose <QUOTE>polymorphic data types</QUOTE>
    include templates for higher-order transformations between data types.
    Moreover, data types for most
    functions
    in ML are never explicitly declared by the programmer.  Instead, ML includes a 
    
    <EM>type-inferencing</EM> mechanism that uses information in the environment
      to deduce the data types for newly defined
      functions.
