    Streams with delayed evaluation can be a powerful modeling tool,
    providing many of the benefits of local state and assignment.
    Moreover, they avoid some of the theoretical tangles that accompany
    the introduction of assignment into a programming language.

    The stream approach can be illuminating because it allows us to build
    systems with different module boundaries than systems organized around
    assignment to state variables.  For example, we can think of an entire
    time series (or signal) as a focus of interest, rather than the values
    of the state variables at individual moments.  This makes it
    convenient to combine and compare components of state from different
    moments.

  \subsubsection{
    Formulating iterations as stream processes
  

  
  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
    In section~\ref{sec:recursion-and-iteration}, we introduced iterative
    processes, which proceed by updating state variables.  We know now
    that we can represent state as a <QUOTE>timeless</QUOTE> stream of values rather
    than as a set of variables to be updated.  Let's adopt this
    perspective in revisiting the square-root
    function
    from
    section~\ref{sec:sqrt}.  Recall that the idea is to generate a
    sequence of better and better guesses for the square root of $x$ by
    applying over and over again the
    function
    that improves guesses:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function sqrt_improve(guess, x) {
    return average(guess, x / guess);
}
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
    In our original {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sqrt$}
    function, we made these guesses be the
    successive values of a state variable. Instead we can generate the
    infinite stream of guesses, starting with an initial guess of 1:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
function sqrt_stream(x) {
    const guesses =
        pair(1.0,
             () => stream_map(guess => sqrt_improve(guess, x),
                              guesses);
            );
    return guesses;
}
display(eval_stream(sqrt_stream(2), 5));
// [1, [1.5, [1.4166666666666665, [1.4142156862745097,
// [1.4142135623746899, null]]]]]
\end{JavaScript}

  

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function sqrt_stream(x) {
    const guesses =
        pair(1.0,
             () => stream_map(guess => sqrt_improve(guess, x),
                              guesses);
            );
    return guesses;
}
display(eval_stream(sqrt_stream(2), 5));
// [1, [1.5, [1.4166666666666665, [1.4142156862745097,
// [1.4142135623746899, null]]]]]
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We can generate more and more terms of the stream to get better and
    better guesses.  If we like, we can write a
    function
    that keeps
    generating terms until the answer is good enough.  (See
    exercise~\ref{ex:stream-limit}.)
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Another iteration that we can treat in the same way is to generate an
    approximation to $\pi$, based upon the alternating series that we saw
    in section~\ref{sec:procedures-as-parameters}:

    
      \[
      \frac {\pi}{4} = 1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+\cdots
      \]
    
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We first generate the stream of summands of the series (the reciprocals
    of the odd integers, with alternating signs).  Then we take the stream
    of sums of more and more terms (using the 
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$partial_sums$} function
    of exercise~\ref{ex:partial-sums}) and scale the result by 4:
    
\begin{JavaScript}
function pi_summands(n) {
    return pair(1.0 / n, 
                () => stream_map(x => -x,
                                 pi_summands(n + 2))
               );
}

const pi_stream = 
    scale_stream(partial_sums(pi_summands(1)), 4);
display_stream(eval_stream(pi_stream, 8));
// [4, [2.666666666666667, [3.466666666666667,
// [2.8952380952380956, [3.3396825396825403, 
// [2.9760461760461765, [3.2837384837384844, 
// [3.017071817071818, null]]]]]]]]
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
    This gives us a stream of better and better approximations to $\pi$,
    although the approximations converge rather slowly.  Eight terms of
    the sequence bound the value of $\pi$ between 3.284 and 3.017.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
    So far, our use of the stream of states approach is not much different
    from updating state variables.  But streams give us an opportunity to
    do some interesting tricks.  For example, we can transform a stream
    with a 
    
    <EM>sequence accelerator</EM> that converts a sequence of
    approximations to a new sequence that converges to the same value as
    the original, only faster.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
    One such accelerator, due to the eighteenth-century Swiss mathematician
    
    Leonhard Euler, works well with sequences that are partial sums of
    alternating series (series of terms with alternating signs).
    In Euler's technique, if $S_n$ is the $n$th term
    of the original sum sequence, then the accelerated sequence has terms
    
      \[ 
      S_{n+1} - \frac{(S_{n+1}-S_n)^2}{S_{n-1}-2S_n+S_{n+1}}
      \]
     
    Thus, if the original sequence is represented as a stream of values,
    the transformed sequence is given by

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function euler_transform(s) {
    const s0 = stream_ref(s, 0);
    const s1 = stream_ref(s, 1);
    const s2 = stream_ref(s, 2);
    return pair(s2 - 
                square(s2 - s1) / (s0 + (-2) * s1 + s2),
                () => euler_transform(stream_tail(s)));
}
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We can demonstrate Euler acceleration with our sequence of
    approximations to $\pi$:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
display_stream(euler_transform(pi_stream));
// 3.166666666666667
// 3.1333333333333337
// 3.1452380952380956
// 3.13968253968254
// 3.1427128427128435
// 3.1408813408813416
// 3.142071817071818
// 3.1412548236077655
// ...
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Even better, we can accelerate the accelerated sequence, and
    recursively accelerate that, and so on.  Namely, we create a stream of
    streams (a structure we'll call a 
    
    <EM>tableau</EM>) in which each stream
    is the transform of the preceding one:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function make_tableau(transform, s) {
    return pair(s, () => make_tableau(transform, transform(s)));
}
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
    The tableau has the form

    
      \[
      \begin{array}{llllll}
      s_{00} & s_{01} & s_{02} & s_{03} & s_{04} & \ldots\\
      & s_{10} & s_{11} & s_{12} & s_{13} & \ldots\\
      &        & s_{20} & s_{21} & s_{22} & \ldots\\
      &        &        &        & \ldots &
      \end{array}
      \]
    
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p14' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Finally, we form a sequence by taking the first term in each row of
    the tableau:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function accelerated_sequence(transform, s) {
    return stream_map(head, make_tableau(transform, s));
}
\end{JavaScript}


    We can demonstrate this kind of <QUOTE>super-acceleration</QUOTE> of the
    $\pi$ sequence:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
display(eval_stream(accelerated_sequence(euler_transform,
                                         pi_stream),
                    8));
// [4, [3.166666666666667, [3.142105263157895,
// [3.141599357319005, [3.1415927140337785, [3.1415926539752927,
// [3.1415926535911765, [3.141592653589778, null]]]]]]]]
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p15' class='permalink'></a><p>
    The result is impressive.  Taking eight terms of the sequence yields
    the correct value of $\pi$ to 14 decimal places.  If we had used only
    the original $\pi$ sequence, we would need to compute on the order of
    $10^{13}$ terms (i.e., expanding the series far enough so that the
    individual terms are less then $10^{-13}$) to get that much accuracy!
    
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p16' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We could have implemented these acceleration techniques without
    using streams.  But the stream formulation is particularly elegant and
    convenient because the entire sequence of states is available to us as a
    data structure that can be manipulated with a uniform set of
    operations.

    Louis Reasoner asks why the 
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sqrt_stream$} function
    was not
    written in the following more straightforward way, without
    the local variable {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$guesses$}:
    
\begin{JavaScript}
function sqrt_stream(x) {
    return pair(1.0,

    Alyssa P. Hacker replies that this version of the
    function
    is
    considerably less efficient because it performs redundant computation.
    Explain Alyssa's answer.  Would the two versions still differ in
    efficiency if our implementation of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$delay$} used only {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$???$} without using the optimization provided by {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$memo-proc$} (section~\ref{sec:delayed-lists})?

  \subsubsection{
    Infinite streams of pairs
  

  
  
  
  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p17' class='permalink'></a><p>
    In section~\ref{sec:nested-mappings}, we saw how the sequence paradigm
    handles traditional nested loops as processes defined on sequences of
    pairs.  If we generalize this technique to infinite streams, then we
    can write programs that are not easily represented as loops, because
    the <QUOTE>looping</QUOTE> must range over an infinite set.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p18' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
    For example, suppose we want to generalize the 
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$prime_sum_pairs$} function
    of section~\ref{sec:nested-mappings} to produce the stream
    of pairs of <EM>all</EM> integers $(i,j)$ with $i \leq j$ such that $i+j$
    is prime.  If 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$int_pairs$} is the sequence of all pairs of integers $(i,j)$
    with $i \leq j$, then our required stream is simply<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
stream_filter(pair => is_prime(head(pair) + head(tail(pair))),
              int_pairs);
\end{JavaScript}

  

    
\begin{JavaScript}
stream_filter(pair => is_prime(head(pair) + head(tail(pair))),
              int_pairs);
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p19' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Our problem, then, is to produce the stream 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$int_pairs$}.  More
    generally, suppose we have two streams $S = (S_i)$ and $T = (T_j)$,
    and imagine the infinite rectangular array
    
      \[
      \begin{array}{cccc}
      (S_0,T_0) & (S_0,T_1) & (S_0, T_2) & \ldots\\
      (S_1,T_0) & (S_1,T_1) & (S_1, T_2) & \ldots\\
      (S_2,T_0) & (S_2,T_1) & (S_2, T_2) & \ldots\\
      \ldots
      \end{array}
      \]
    
    We wish to generate a stream that contains all the pairs in the array
    that lie on or above the diagonal, i.e., the pairs
    
      \[
      \begin{array}{cccc}
      (S_0,T_0) & (S_0,T_1) & (S_0, T_2) & \ldots\\
      & (S_1,T_1) & (S_1, T_2) & \ldots\\
      &           & (S_2, T_2) & \ldots\\
      &           &            & \ldots
      \end{array}
      \]
    
    (If we take both $S$ and $T$ to be the stream of integers, then this
    will be our desired stream 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$int_pairs$}.)  
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p20' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Call the general stream of pairs 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$pairs(S, T)$}, and consider it to
    be composed of three parts: the pair $(S_0,T_0)$, the
    rest of the pairs in the first row, and the remaining pairs:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>
      \[
      \begin{array}{c|ccc}
      (S_0,T_0) & (S_0,T_1) & (S_0, T_2) & \ldots\\
      \hline{} %--------------------------------------------------- \\
      & (S_1,T_1) & (S_1, T_2) & \ldots\\
      &           & (S_2, T_2) & \ldots\\
      &           &            & \ldots
      \end{array}
      \]
    
    Observe that the third piece in this decomposition (pairs that are not in the first row) is (recursively) the pairs formed from 
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$stream_tail(S)$}
    and 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$stream_tail(T)$}.  
    Also note that the second piece (the rest of the first row) is
    
\begin{JavaScript}
stream_map(x => list(head(s), x),
           stream_tail(t));
\end{JavaScript}

  
    
      \[
      \begin{array}{c|ccc}
      (S_0,T_0) & (S_0,T_1) & (S_0, T_2) & \ldots\\
      \hline{} %--------------------------------------------------- \\
      & (S_1,T_1) & (S_1, T_2) & \ldots\\
      &           & (S_2, T_2) & \ldots\\
      &           &            & \ldots
      \end{array}
      \]
    
    Observe that the third piece in this decomposition (pairs that are not in the first row) is (recursively) the pairs formed from 
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$stream_tail(S)$}
    and 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$stream_tail(T)$}.  
    Also note that the second piece (the rest of the first row) is
    
\begin{JavaScript}
stream_map(x => list(head(s), x),
           stream_tail(t));
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p21' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Thus we can form our stream of pairs as follows:
    
\begin{JavaScript}
function pairs(s, t) {
    return pair(list(head(s), head(t)), 
                () => <combine_in_some_way>(
                         stream_map(x => list(head(s), x),
                                    stream_tail(t)),
                         pairs(stream_tail(s), stream_tail(t)))
               );
}
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p22' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
    In order to complete the
    function, we must choose some way to combine
    the two inner streams.  One idea is to use the stream analog of the
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$append$}
    function
    from section~\ref{sec:sequences}:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function stream_append(s1, s2) {
    return is_null(s1)
        ? s2
        : pair(head(s1), 
               () => stream_append(stream_tail(s1), s2)
              );
}
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p23' class='permalink'></a><p>
    This is unsuitable for infinite streams, however,
    because it takes all the elements from the first stream before
    incorporating the second stream.
    In particular, if we try to generate all pairs of positive integers using

    
\begin{JavaScript}
pairs(integers, integers);
\end{JavaScript}


    our stream of results will first try to run through all pairs with the
    first integer equal to 1, and hence will never produce pairs with any
    other value of the first integer.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p24' class='permalink'></a><p>
    To handle infinite streams, we need to devise an order of combination
    that ensures that every element will eventually be reached if we let
    our program run long enough.  An elegant way to accomplish this is
    with the following {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$interleave$}
    function:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
function interleave(s1, s2) {
    return is_null(s1)
        ? s2;
        : pair(head(s1), 
               () => interleave(s2, stream_tail(s1))
              );
}
\end{JavaScript}

  

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function interleave(s1, s2) {
    return is_null(s1)
        ? s2;
        : pair(head(s1), 
               () => interleave(s2, stream_tail(s1))
              );
}
\end{JavaScript}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p25' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Since {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$interleave$} takes elements alternately from the two streams,
    every element of the second stream will eventually find its way into
    the interleaved stream, even if the first stream is infinite.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p26' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We can thus generate the required stream of pairs as
    
\begin{JavaScript}
function pairs(s, t) {
    return pair(list(head(s), head(t)), 
   	        () => interleave(stream_map(x => list(head(s), 
                                                      x),

    Louis Reasoner thinks that building a stream of pairs from three
    parts is unnecessarily complicated.  Instead of separating the
    pair $(S_0,T_0)$ from the rest of the pairs in the first row,
    he proposes to work with the whole first row, as follows:
    
\begin{JavaScript}
function pairs(s, t) {
    return interleave(stream_map(x => list(head(s), x),
                                 t), 
                      pair(stream_tail(s), stream_tail(t)));
}
\end{JavaScript}

    Does this work?  Consider what happens if we evaluate

    It would be nice to be able to generate streams in which the pairs
    appear in some useful order, rather than in the order that results
    from an <EM>ad hoc</EM> interleaving process.  We can use a technique
    similar to the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$merge$}
    function
    of exercise~\ref{ex:merge}, if we
    define a way to say that one pair of integers is <QUOTE>less than</QUOTE>
    another.  One way to do this is to define a <QUOTE>weighting function</QUOTE>
    $W(i,j)$ and stipulate that $(i_1,j_1)$ is less than $(i_2,j_2)$ if
    $W(i_1,j_1) < W(i_2,j_2)$.  Write a
    
    function {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$merge_weighted$}
    that is like {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$merge$}, except that 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$merge_weighted$} takes an
    additional argument {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$weight$}, which is a
    function
    that computes
    the weight of a pair, and is used to determine the order in which

    that
    takes two streams, together with a
    function
    that computes a weighting

    weight.  Use your

    Using this,

    Streams as signals
  

  
  
  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p27' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We began our discussion of streams by describing them as computational
    analogs of the <QUOTE>signals</QUOTE> in signal-processing systems.  In fact, we
    can use streams to model signal-processing systems in a very direct
    way, representing the values of a signal at successive time intervals
    as consecutive elements of a stream.  For instance, we can implement
    an 
    
    <EM>integrator</EM> or 
    <EM>summer</EM> that, for an input stream
    $x=(x_{i})$, an initial value $C$, and a small increment $dt$,
    accumulates the sum
    
      \[ S_i =C +\sum_{j=1}^{i} x_{j} \, dt \]
    
    and returns the stream of values $S=(S_{i})$.  The following {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$integral$}
    function
    is reminiscent of the <QUOTE>implicit style</QUOTE> definition of the
    stream of integers (section~\ref{sec:infinite-streams}):

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function integral(integrand, initial_value, dt) {
    const integ = pair(initial_value, 
        () => add_streams(scale_stream(integrand, dt),
                          integ);
        );
    return integ;
}

    back through the same adder.  The self-reference in the definition of
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$int$} is reflected in the figure by the feedback loop that
    connects the output of the adder to one of the inputs.

      We can model electrical circuits using streams to represent the values
      of currents or voltages at a sequence of times.  For instance, suppose
      we have an <EM>RC circuit</EM> consisting of a resistor of resistance $R$
      and a capacitor of capacitance $C$ in series.  The voltage response
      $v$ of the circuit to an injected current $i$ is determined by the
      formula in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}, whose structure is shown by the accompanying
      signal-flow diagram.

      Write a

      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$RC$} that models this circuit.  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$RC$} should
      take as inputs the values of $R$, $C$, and $dt$ and should return a
      function
      that takes as inputs a stream representing the current $i$
      and an initial value for the capacitor voltage $v_{0}$ and produces as
      output the stream of voltages $v$.  For example, you should be able to
      use {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$RC$} to model an RC circuit with $R = 5$ ohms, $C = 1$ farad,
      and a 0.5-second time step by evaluating {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$const RC1 = RC(5, 1, 0.5)$}.  This defines {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$RC1$} as a
      function

      voltage and produces the output stream of voltages.

\begin{Exercise}

    
    
    Alyssa P. Hacker is designing a system to process signals coming from
    physical sensors.  One important feature she wishes to produce is a
    signal that describes the <EM>zero crossings</EM> of the input signal.
    That is, the resulting signal should be $+1$ whenever the input signal
    changes from negative to positive, $-1$ whenever the input signal changes from positive to negative, and 0 otherwise.  (Assume that the
    sign of a 0 input is positive.)  For example, a typical input signal
    with its associated zero-crossing signal would be
    
\begin{JavaScript}
... 1  2  1.5  1  0.5  -0.1  -2  -3  -2  -0.5  0.2  3  4 ...
... 0  0    0  0    0     -1  0   0   0     0    1  0  0 ...
\end{JavaScript}


    In Alyssa's system, the signal from the sensor is represented as a
    stream 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sense_data$} 
    and the stream 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$zero_crossings$} is
    the corresponding stream of zero crossings.  Alyssa first writes a
    function
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sign_change_detector$} that takes two values as
    arguments and compares the signs of the values to produce an
    appropriate $0$, $1$, or $-1$.  She then constructs her zero-crossing
    stream as follows:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function make_zero_crossings(input_stream, last_value) {
    return pair(sign_change_detector(head(input_stream),
                                     last_value),
                () => make_zero_crossings(
                          stream_tail(input_stream),
                          head(input_stream)));
}
const zero_crossings = make_zero_crossings(sense_data, 0);
\end{JavaScript}


    Alyssa's boss, Eva Lu Ator, walks by and suggests that this program is
    approximately equivalent to the following one, which uses
    
      
      
	the function 
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$combine_streams$}
	from exercise~\ref{ex:combine-streams}:
      
    
    
\begin{JavaScript}
const zero_crossing = combine_streams(sign_change_detector,
                                      sense_data,
                                      <expression>);
\end{JavaScript}


    Complete the program by supplying the indicated
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$<expression>$}.
    
  
\end{Exercise}


  
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

    
    
    
    
    Unfortunately, Alyssa's zero-crossing detector in
    exercise~\ref{ex:zero-crossing} proves to be insufficient, because the
    noisy signal from the sensor leads to spurious zero crossings.  Lem E.
    Tweakit, a hardware specialist, suggests that Alyssa smooth the signal
    to filter out the noise before extracting the zero crossings.  Alyssa
    takes his advice and decides to extract the zero crossings from the
    signal constructed by averaging each value of the sense data with the
    previous value.  She explains the problem to her assistant, Louis
    Reasoner, who attempts to implement the idea, altering Alyssa's program as
    follows:

    
\begin{JavaScript}
function make_zero_crossings(input_stream, last_value) {
    const avpt = (head(input_stream) + last_value) / 2;
    return pair(sign_change_detector(avpt, last_value),
        () => make_zero_crossings(
                  stream_tail(input_stream), 
                  avpt);
		 );
}
\end{JavaScript}


    This does not correctly implement Alyssa's plan.
    Find the bug that Louis has installed
    and fix it without changing the structure of the program.  (Hint: You
    will need to increase the number of arguments to 
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_zero_crossings$}.)
    
  
\end{Exercise}


  
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

    
    
    
    
    Eva Lu Ator has a criticism of Louis's approach in
    exercise~\ref{ex:zero-crossing-2}.  The program he wrote is not modular,
    because it intermixes the operation of smoothing with the
    zero-crossing extraction.  For example, the extractor should not have
    to be changed if Alyssa finds a better way to condition her input
    signal.  Help Louis by writing a
    function
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$smooth$} that takes a
    stream as input and produces a stream in which each element is the
    average of two successive input stream elements.  Then use {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$smooth$} as a component to implement the zero-crossing detector in a
    more modular style.
