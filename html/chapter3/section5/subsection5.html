    As we saw in section \ref{sec:benefits-of-assignment}, one of the
    major benefits of introducing assignment is that we can increase the
    modularity of our systems by encapsulating, or <QUOTE>hiding,</QUOTE> parts of
    the state of a large system within local variables.  Stream models can
    provide an equivalent modularity without the use of assignment.  As an
    
    
    illustration, we can reimplement the Monte Carlo estimation of $\pi$,
    which we examined in section \ref{sec:benefits-of-assignment}, from a
    stream-processing point of view.

    The key modularity issue was that we wished to hide the internal state
    of a random-number generator from programs that used random numbers.
    We began with a
    
    function <kbd>rand_update</kbd>,
    whose successive values furnished our supply of random numbers, and used this to produce a
    random-number generator:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_70_1_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_rand() {
    let x = random_init;
    function rand() {
        x = rand_update(x);
        return x;
    }
    return rand;
}
const rand = make_rand();
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
    In the stream formulation there is no random-number generator <EM>per
    se</EM>, just a stream of random numbers produced by successive calls to
    
      
      <kbd>rand_update</kbd>:
      
    
    

    
    
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We use this to construct the stream of outcomes of the
    Cesàro experiment performed on consecutive pairs in the
    
      
      
	<kbd>random_numbers</kbd>
      
    
    stream:

    

    
    
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
    The
    
      
      <kbd>cesaro_stream</kbd>
    
    is now fed to a
    
      
      <kbd>monte_carlo</kbd>
    
    function,
    which produces a stream of estimates of probabilities.  The results
    are then converted into a stream of estimates of $\pi$.
    This version of the program doesn't need a parameter telling how many trials to
    perform.  Better estimates of $\pi$ (from performing more
    experiments) are obtained by looking farther into the <kbd>pi</kbd>
    stream:

    

    
    
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
    There is considerable modularity in this approach, because we still
    can formulate a general 
    
    <kbd>monte_carlo</kbd> function
    that can deal with
    arbitrary experiments.  Yet there is no assignment or local state.

    Exercise \ref{ex:random-with-reset}
    discussed generalizing the random-number generator to
    allow one to reset the random-number sequence so as to produce
    repeatable sequences of <QUOTE>random</QUOTE> numbers.  Produce a stream
    formulation of this same generator that operates on an input stream of
    requests to <kbd>generate</kbd> a new random number or to
    <kbd>reset</kbd> the
    sequence to a specified value and that produces the desired stream of
    random numbers.  Don't use assignment in your solution.

    will not have an argument telling how many trials
    to perform.  Instead, it will produce a stream of estimates based on

    Let us now return to the issues of objects and state that were raised
    at the beginning of this chapter and examine them in a new light.  We
    introduced assignment and mutable objects to provide a mechanism for
    modular construction of programs that model systems with state.
    We constructed computational
    objects with local state variables and used assignment to modify these
    variables.  We modeled the temporal behavior of the objects in the
    world by the temporal behavior of the corresponding computational
    objects.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Now we have seen that streams provide an alternative way to model
    objects with local state.  We can model a changing quantity, such as
    the local state of some object, using a stream that represents the
    time history of successive states.  In essence, we represent time
    explicitly, using streams, so that we decouple time in our simulated
    world from the sequence of events that take place during evaluation.
    Indeed, because of the presence of <kbd>delay</kbd> there may be little
    relation between simulated time in the model and the order of events
    during the evaluation.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
    In order to contrast these two approaches to modeling, let us
    reconsider the implementation of a <QUOTE>withdrawal processor</QUOTE> that
    
    monitors the balance in a bank account.  In
    section \ref{sec:costs-of-assignment} we implemented a simplified
    version of such a processor:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_70_2_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_simplified_withdraw(balance) {
    function withdraw(amount) {
        balance = balance - amount;
        return balance;
    }
    return withdraw;
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Calls to
    
      
      
	<kbd>make_simplified_withdraw</kbd>
      
    
    produce computational objects,
    each with a local state variable <kbd>balance</kbd> that is decremented by
    successive calls to the object.  The object takes an <kbd>amount</kbd> as
    an argument and returns the new balance.  We can imagine the user of a
    bank account typing a sequence of inputs to such an object and
    observing the sequence of returned values shown on a display screen.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Alternatively, we can model a withdrawal processor as a
    function
    that
    takes as input a balance and a stream of amounts to withdraw and
    produces the stream of successive balances in the account:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_70_3_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint' title='Evaluate Javascript expression'
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function stream_withdraw(balance, amount_stream) {      
    return pair(balance,
                () => stream_withdraw(
                          balance - head(amount_stream),
                          stream_tail(amount_stream)));   
}
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

	The function <kbd>stream_withdraw</kbd>
      
    
    implements a well-defined mathematical function whose
    output is fully determined by its input.  Suppose, however, that the
    input
    
      
      
	<kbd>amount_stream</kbd>
      
    
    is the stream of successive values typed by
    the user and that the resulting stream of balances is displayed.
    Then, from the perspective of the user who is typing values and
    watching results, the stream process has the same behavior as the
    object created by
    
      
      <kbd>make_simplified_withdraw</kbd>.
    
    However, with the stream version, there is no assignment, no local state variable,
    and consequently none of the theoretical difficulties that we encountered
    
    in section \ref{sec:costs-of-assignment}.  Yet the system has state!
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
    This is really remarkable.  Even though
    
      
      
	<kbd>stream_withdraw</kbd>
      
    
    implements a
    well-defined mathematical function whose behavior does not change, the
    user's perception here is one of interacting with a system that has a
    changing state.  One way to resolve this paradox is to realize that it
    is the user's temporal existence that imposes state on the system.  If
    the user could step back from the interaction and think in terms of
    streams of balances rather than individual transactions, the system
    would appear stateless.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p14' class='permalink'></a><p>
    From the point of view of one part of a complex process, the other
    parts appear to change with time.  They have hidden time-varying local
    state.  If we wish to write programs that model this kind of natural
    decomposition in our world (as we see it from our viewpoint as a part of
    that world) with
    structures in our computer, we make computational objects that are not
    functional—they must change with time.  We model state with local
    state variables, and we model the changes of state with assignments to
    those variables.  By doing this we make the time of execution of a
    computation model time in the world that we are part of, and thus we
    get <QUOTE>objects</QUOTE> in our computer.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p15' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Modeling with objects is powerful and intuitive, largely because this
    matches the perception of interacting with a world of which we are
    part.  However, as we've seen repeatedly throughout this chapter,
    these models raise thorny problems of constraining the order of events
    and of synchronizing multiple processes.  The possibility of avoiding
    these problems has stimulated the development of 
    
    
    <EM>functional
    programming languages</EM>, which do not include any provision for
    assignment or mutable data.  In such a language, all
    functions
    implement well-defined mathematical functions of their arguments,
    whose behavior does not change.  The functional approach is extremely
    
    
    attractive for dealing with concurrent systems.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p16' class='permalink'></a><p>
    On the other hand, if we look closely, we can see time-related
    problems creeping into functional models as well.  One particularly
    troublesome area arises when we wish to design interactive systems,
    especially ones that model interactions between independent entities.
    For instance, consider once more the implementation a banking system
    that permits joint bank accounts.  In a conventional system using
    assignment and objects, we would model the fact that Peter and Paul
    share an account by having both Peter and Paul send their transaction
    requests to the same bank-account object, as we saw in
    section \ref{sec:costs-of-assignment}.
    From the stream point of view, where there are no <QUOTE>objects</QUOTE> <EM>per
    se</EM>, we have already indicated that a bank account can be modeled as a
    process that operates on a stream of transaction requests to produce a
    stream of responses.  Accordingly, we could model the fact that Peter
    and Paul have a joint bank account by merging Peter's stream of
    transaction requests with Paul's stream of requests and feeding the
    result to the bank-account stream process, as shown in
    figure \ref{fig:joint-account-stream}.

    
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\maxsizebox{\linewidth}{0.8\paperheight}{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{{img\string_original/ch3-Z-G-60}.svg}}
\caption{A joint bank account, modeled by merging two streams of transaction requests.
      }
\label{fig:joint-account-stream}
\end{figure}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p17' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
    The trouble with this formulation is in the notion of <EM>merge</EM>.  It
    will not do to merge the two streams by simply taking alternately one
    request from Peter and one request from Paul. Suppose Paul accesses
    the account only very rarely.  We could hardly force Peter to wait for
    Paul to access the account before he could issue a second transaction.
    However such a merge is implemented, it must interleave the two
    transaction streams in some way that is constrained by <QUOTE>real
    time</QUOTE> as perceived by Peter and Paul, in the sense that, if Peter and
    Paul meet, they can agree that certain transactions were processed
    before the meeting, and other transactions were processed after the
    meeting.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p18' class='permalink'></a><p>
    This is precisely the same constraint that we had to deal with in
    section \ref{sec:nature-of-time}, where we found the need to introduce
    explicit synchronization to ensure a <QUOTE>correct</QUOTE> order of events in
    concurrent processing of objects with state.  Thus, in an attempt to
    support the functional style, the need to merge inputs from different
    agents reintroduces the same problems that the functional style was
    meant to eliminate.

    We began this chapter with the goal of building computational models
    whose structure matches our perception of the real world we are trying
    to model.  We can model the world as a collection of separate,
    time-bound, interacting objects with state, or we can model the world
    as a single, timeless, stateless unity.  Each view has powerful
    advantages, but neither view alone is completely satisfactory.  A
    grand unification has yet to emerge.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>
