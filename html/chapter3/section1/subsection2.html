        As we shall see, introducing assignment into our programming language
        leads us into a thicket of difficult conceptual issues.  Nevertheless,
        viewing systems as collections of objects with local state is a
        powerful technique for maintaining a modular design.  As a simple
        example, consider the design of a
        function
        {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand$} that, whenever
        it is called, returns an integer chosen at random.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p2' class='permalink'></a><p>
        
        It is not at all clear what is meant by <QUOTE>chosen at random.</QUOTE>  What we
        presumably want is for successive calls to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand$} to produce a
        sequence of numbers that has statistical properties of uniform
        distribution.  We will not discuss methods for generating suitable
        sequences here.  Rather, let us assume that we have a
        function
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand_update$} 
that has the property that if we start with a given
        number {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x_1$} and form

        
\begin{JavaScript}
x_2 = rand_update(x_1);
x_3 = rand_update(x_2);
\end{JavaScript}

        then the sequence of values {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x_1$},
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x_2$},
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x_3$},
	…, will have the
        desired statistical properties.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
        We can implement {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand$} as a
        function
        with a local state variable
        {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} that is initialized to some fixed value 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$random_init$}.
        Each call to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand$} computes 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand_update$} 
of the current
        value of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}, returns this as the random number, and also stores
        this as the new value of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}.

        Of course, we could generate the same sequence of random numbers
        without using assignment by simply calling 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand_update$} 
directly.
        However, this would mean that any part of our program that used random
        numbers would have to explicitly remember the current value of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}
        to be passed as an argument to 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand_update$}.  To realize what an
        annoyance this would be, consider using random numbers to implement a
        technique called

        The Monte Carlo method consists of choosing sample experiments at
        random from a large set and then making deductions on the basis of the
        probabilities estimated from tabulating the results of those
        experiments.  For example, we can approximate 
        
        $\pi$ using the fact
        that $6/\pi^2$ is the probability that two integers chosen at random
        will have no factors in common; that is, that their greatest common
        divisor will be 1.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>$\pi$, we perform a large number of experiments.
        In each experiment we choose two integers at random and perform a test
        
        to see if their GCD is 1.  The fraction of times that the test is
        passed gives us our estimate of $6/\pi^2$, and from this we obtain our
        approximation to $\pi$.
       To obtain

        While the program is still simple, it betrays some painful
        breaches of modularity.  In our first version of the program, using
        {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand$}, we can express the Monte Carlo method directly as
        a general 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$monte_carlo$} 
        function
        that takes as an argument an
        arbitrary {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$experiment$}
        function.  In our second version of the
        program, with no local state for the random-number generator, 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$random_gcd_test$} 
must explicitly manipulate the random numbers {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x1$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x2$} and recycle {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x2$} through the iterative loop as
        the new input to 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand_update$}.
This explicit handling of the
        random numbers intertwines the structure of accumulating test results
        with the fact that our particular experiment uses two random numbers,
        whereas other Monte Carlo experiments might use one random number or
        three.  Even the top-level
        function
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$estimate_pi$}
        has to be
        concerned with supplying an initial random number.  The fact that the
        random-number generator's insides are leaking out into other parts of
        the program makes it difficult for us to isolate the Monte Carlo idea
        so that it can be applied to other tasks.  In the first version of the
        program, assignment encapsulates the state of the random-number
        generator within the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand$}
        function, so that the details of
        random-number generation remain independent of the rest of the
        program.

        The general phenomenon illustrated by the Monte Carlo example is this:
        From the point of view of one part of a complex process, the other
        parts appear to change with time.  They have hidden time-varying local
        state.  If we wish to write computer programs whose structure reflects
        this decomposition, we make
        computational objects (such as bank accounts and random-number
        generators) whose behavior changes with time.  We model state with
        local state variables, and we model the changes of state with
        assignments to those variables.

<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
        It is tempting to conclude this discussion by saying that, by
        introducing assignment and the technique of hiding state in local
        variables, we are able to structure systems in a more modular fashion
        than if all state had to be manipulated explicitly, by passing
        additional parameters.  Unfortunately, as we shall see, the story is
        not so simple.

\begin{Exercise}

        
          
          
          <EM>Monte Carlo integration</EM> is a method of estimating definite
          integrals by means of Monte Carlo simulation.  Consider computing the
          area of a region of space described by a predicate $P(x, y)$ that is
          true for points $(x, y)$ in the region and false for points not in the
          region.  For example, the region contained within a circle of radius
          $3$ centered at $(5, 7)$ is described by the predicate that tests
          whether $(x-5)^2 + (y-7)^2\leq 3^2$.  To estimate the area of the
          region described by such a predicate, begin by choosing a rectangle
          that contains the region.  For example, a rectangle with diagonally
          opposite corners at $(2, 4)$ and $(8, 10)$ contains the circle above.
          The desired integral is the area of that portion of the rectangle that
          lies in the region.  We can estimate the integral by picking, at
          random, points $(x,y)$ that lie in the rectangle, and testing $P(x,
            y)$ for each point to determine whether the point lies in the region.
          If we try this with many points, then the fraction of points that fall
          in the region should give an estimate of the proportion of the
          rectangle that lies in the region.  Hence, multiplying this fraction
          by the area of the entire rectangle should produce an estimate of the
          integral.
        <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p></p></div>
          Implement Monte Carlo integration as a
          function
          
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$estimate_integral$}
that takes as arguments a predicate {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$P$}, upper
          and lower bounds {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x1$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x2$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y1$}, and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y2$} for the
          rectangle, and the number of trials to perform in order to produce the
          estimate.  Your
          function
          should use the same 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$monte_carlo$}
          function
          that was used above to estimate $\pi$.  Use
          your 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$estimate_integral$}
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$$} 
to produce an estimate of $\pi$ by
          measuring the area of a unit circle.

\begin{Exercise}

        
        
        
        It is useful to be able to reset a random-number generator to produce
        a sequence starting from a given value.  Design a new {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand$}
        function
        that is called with an argument that is either the symbol
        {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$generate$} or the symbol {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reset$} and behaves as follows: {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rand("generate")$} produces a new random number; 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$(rand("reset"))($\textit{new-value}$)$} resets the internal state variable to the designated
        $\textit{new-value}$.
Thus, by resetting the state, one can generate
        repeatable sequences.  These are very handy to have when testing and
        debugging programs that use random numbers.
