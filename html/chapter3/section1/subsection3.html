        As we have seen, the 

assignment statement
enables us to model objects
        that have local state.  However, this advantage comes at a price.  Our
        programming language can no longer be interpreted in terms of the
        substitution model of
        function
        application that we introduced in
        section~\ref{sec:substitution-model}.  Moreover, no simple model with
        <QUOTE>nice</QUOTE> mathematical properties can be an adequate framework for
        dealing with objects and assignment in programming languages.

        So long as we do not use assignments, two evaluations of the same
        function
        with the same arguments will produce the same result, so
        that
        functions
        can be viewed as computing mathematical functions.
        Programming without any use of assignments, as we did throughout the
        first two chapters of this book, is accordingly known as 
        
        <EM>
          functional programming</EM>.

        To understand how assignment complicates matters, consider a
        simplified version of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_withdraw$}
        function
        of
        section~\ref{sec:local-state-variables} that does not bother to check
        for an insufficient amount:

        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function make_simplified_withdraw(balance) {
    return amount => {
               balance = balance - amount;

           };
}

	  The function

	returns a

        We can use the substitution model to explain how {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_decrementer$} works.  For instance, let us analyze the evaluation
        of the expression

        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
(make_decrementer(25))(20);
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=4&prgrm=BQWwhg1gpg+gJlAxgJyiKA7ALlZwBMArAJTEEAMxA3EA}{\usebox\lstbox}



        We first simplify the operator of the combination by substituting $25$
        for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$balance$} in the body of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make-decrementer$}.  This reduces
        the expression to

        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
(amount => 25 - amount)(20);
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=4&prgrm=BQQwtg9grgdgLgAgLwD4ECYCsCC0DzTwCUw6ADEQNxA}{\usebox\lstbox}


      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
        Now we apply the operator by substituting 20 for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$amount$} in the
        body of the
	
	  
	  function definition
	
	  expression:

        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
25 - 20;
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=4&prgrm=EwVgBAtGwAwNxA}{\usebox\lstbox}



        The final answer is 5.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
        Observe, however, what happens if we attempt a similar substitution
        analysis with {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_simplified_withdraw$}:

        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
(make_simplified_withdraw(25))(20);
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
        We first simplify the operator by substituting 25 for
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$balance$} in
        
	the return expression of
	{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_simplified_withdraw$}.
        This reduces the expression to<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
(amount => {
     balance = 25 - amount; 
     return 25;
 })(20);
\end{JavaScript}

      

        
\begin{JavaScript}
(amount => {
     balance = 25 - amount; 
     return 25;
 })(20);
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
        Now we apply the function
	by substituting 20 for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$amount$} in the
        body of the 
	function:

        
\begin{JavaScript}
balance = 25 - 20;
return 25;
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
        If we adhered to the substitution model, we would have to say that the
        meaning of the
        function
        application is to first set {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$balance$} to
        5 and then return 25 as the value of the expression.  This gets the
        wrong answer.  In order to get the correct answer, we would have to
        somehow distinguish the first occurrence of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$balance$} (before the
        effect of the assignment)  from the second occurrence of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$balance$}
        (after the effect of the assignment), and the substitution model
        cannot do this.

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
        The trouble here is that substitution is based ultimately on the
        notion that the symbols in our language are essentially names for
        values.
	<SPLIT>
	  
	  
	    But as soon as we introduce assignment and the idea that the
            value of a variable can change, a variable can no longer be simply a
            name.  Now a variable somehow refers to a place where a value can be
            stored, and the value stored at this place can change.  In
            section~\ref{sec:environment-model}
            we will see how environments play this role of <QUOTE>place</QUOTE> in our
            computational model.

        The issue surfacing here is more profound than the mere breakdown of a
        particular model of computation.  As soon as we introduce change into

        As an example of how this issue arises in programming, consider the
        situation where Peter and Paul have a bank account with \$100 in

\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p22' class='permalink'></a><p>
        In the first situation, the two bank accounts are distinct.
        Transactions made by Peter will not affect Paul's account, and vice
        versa.  In the second situation, however, we have defined 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$paul_acc$}
to be <EM>the same thing</EM> as 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$peter_acc$}
In effect,
        Peter and Paul now have a joint bank account, and if Peter makes a
        withdrawal from 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$peter_acc$}
Paul will observe less money in 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$paul_acc$}.
These two similar but distinct situations can cause
        confusion in building computational models.  With the shared account,
        in particular, it can be especially confusing that there is one object
        (the bank account) that has two different names 
({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$peter_acc$}
and
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$paul_acc$}); 
if we are searching for all the places in our program where 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$paul_acc$}
can be changed, we must remember to look also at
        things that change 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$peter_acc$}.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p23' class='permalink'></a><p>
        With reference to the above remarks on <QUOTE>sameness</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>change,</QUOTE>
        observe that if Peter and Paul could only examine their bank balances,
        and could not perform operations that changed the balance, then the
        issue of whether the two accounts are distinct would be moot.  In
        general, so long as we never modify data objects, we can regard a
        compound data object to be precisely the totality of its pieces.  For
        example, a rational number is determined by giving its numerator and
        its denominator.  But this view is no longer valid in the presence of
        change, where a compound data object has an <QUOTE>identity</QUOTE> that is
        something different from the pieces of which it is composed.  A bank
        account is still <QUOTE>the same</QUOTE> bank account even if we change the
        balance by making a withdrawal; conversely, we could have two
        different bank accounts with the same state information.  This
        complication is a consequence, not of our programming language, but of
        our perception of a bank account as an object.  We do not, for
        example, ordinarily regard a rational number as a changeable object
        with identity, such that we could change the numerator and still have
        <QUOTE>the same</QUOTE> rational number.

        Pitfalls of imperative programming
      

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p24' class='permalink'></a><p>
        In contrast to functional programming, programming that makes
        extensive use of assignment is known as 
        
        
        <EM>imperative
          programming</EM>.  In addition to raising complications about
        computational models, programs written in imperative style are
        susceptible to bugs that cannot occur in functional programs.  For
        example, recall the iterative factorial program from
        section~\ref{sec:recursion-and-iteration}:
        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function factorial(n) {
   function iter(product,counter) {
      if (counter > n) {
          return product;
      } else {
          return iter(counter*product,
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
/*!\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=4&prgrm=GYVwdgxgLglg9mABMAhtOAnGKA2AKMASkQG8AoRS0SWBRGKAUwzwAcM4ATEaAGgjjgmGYuUrj6wRHgFDmiAHyIipChPUZGUEBiTsuPKAG41EgL6JGOAM6NV6jVp1IGzGYLDCAVPu59TDoGBsp7MANQAjIQmDmamceKa2rr0wngRvFEmZkA}{\usebox\lstbox}!*/
                       counter+1);
      }
   }
   return iter(1,1);
}

\end{JavaScriptClickable}


        Instead of passing arguments in the internal iterative loop, we could
        adopt a more imperative style by using explicit assignment
        to update the values of the variables {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$product$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$counter$}:
        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}

        This does not change the results produced by the program, but it does
        introduce a subtle trap.  How do we decide the order of the assignments?
        As it happens, the program is correct as written.  But
        writing the assignments in the opposite order
        
\begin{JavaScript}
counter = counter + 1;
product = counter * product;
\end{JavaScript}

        would have produced a different, incorrect result.
        In general, programming with assignment forces us to
        carefully consider the relative orders of the assignments to make sure
        that each statement is using the correct version of the variables that
        have been changed.  This issue simply does not arise in functional
        programs.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>

        The complexity of imperative programs becomes even worse if we
        consider applications in which several processes execute concurrently.  We
        will return to this in section~\ref{sec:time-is-of-the-essence}.
        First, however, we will address the issue of providing a computational
        model for expressions that involve assignment, and explore the uses of
        objects with local state in designing simulations.

\begin{Exercise}
\label{ex:unlabeled43}

        
        Consider the bank account objects created by 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_account$}, 
with
        the password modification described in
        exercise~\ref{ex:password-protection}.  Suppose that our banking
        system requires the ability to make joint accounts.  Define a
        function
        
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_joint$}
that accomplishes this.  
The function {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_joint$}
        should take three arguments.  The first is a password-protected
        account.  The second argument must match the password with which the
        account was defined in order for the 
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_joint$}
operation to
        proceed.  The third argument is a new password.  
The function {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_joint$}
is to create an additional access to the original account using the new
        password.  For example, if 
({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$peter_acc$}
is a bank account with
        password 
({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"open sesame"$}, 
then
        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
// make_joint function to be written by students
const paul_acc = 
    make_joint(peter_acc, "open sesame", "rosebud");
\end{JavaScriptClickable}

        will allow one to make transactions on 
({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$peter_acc$}
using the name
{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$paul_acc$}
and the password {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"rosebud"$}.  You may wish to modify
        your solution to exercise~\ref{ex:password-protection} to accommodate
        this new feature.

\begin{Exercise}

        
        
        When we defined the evaluation model in
        section~\ref{sec:evaluating-combinations}, we said that the first step
        in evaluating an expression is to evaluate its subexpressions.  But we
        never specified the order in which the subexpressions should be
        evaluated (e.g., left to right or right to left).  When we introduce
        assignment, the order in which the arguments to a
        function
        are
        evaluated can make a difference to the result.  Define a simple
        function
        {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$f$} such that evaluating {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$f(0) + f(1)$} will
        return 0 if the arguments to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$+$} are evaluated from left to right
        but will return 1 if the arguments are evaluated from right to left.

          a very simple example of an alias.  In section~\ref{sec:mutable-data}

<a class='footnote-number' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-link-3'>[3] </a><FOOTNOTE>In view of this, it is ironic that introductory programming
          is most often taught in a highly imperative style.  This may be a
          vestige of a belief, common throughout the 1960s and 1970s, that
          programs that call
          functions
          must inherently be less efficient than
          programs that perform assignments.  
          (Steele (1977) 
          
          debunks this
          argument.)  Alternatively it may reflect a view that step-by-step
          assignment is easier for beginners to visualize than
          function
          call.
          Whatever the reason, it often saddles beginning programmers with

          complicate programming and obscure the important ideas.</FOOTNOTE></div>
