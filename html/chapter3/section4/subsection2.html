    We've seen that the difficulty in dealing with concurrent processes is
    rooted in the need to consider the interleaving of the order of events
    in the different processes.  For example, suppose we have two
    processes, one with three ordered events $(a,b,c)$
    and one with three ordered events $(x,y,z)$.  If the
    two processes run concurrently, with no constraints on how their execution is
    interleaved, then there are 20 different possible orderings for the events that
    are consistent with the individual orderings for the two processes:
    
      \[ \begin{array}{cccc}
      (a,b,c,x,y,z) & (a,x,b,y,c,z) & (x,a,b,c,y,z) & (x,a,y,z,b,c)\\
      (a,b,x,c,y,z) & (a,x,b,y,z,c) & (x,a,b,y,c,z) & (x,y,a,b,c,z)\\
      (a,b,x,y,c,z) & (a,x,y,b,c,z) & (x,a,b,y,z,c) & (x,y,a,b,z,c)\\
      (a,b,x,y,z,c) & (a,x,y,b,z,c) & (x,a,y,b,c,z) & (x,y,a,z,b,c)\\
      (a,x,b,c,y,z) & (a,x,y,z,b,c) & (x,a,y,b,z,c) & (x,y,z,a,b,c)
      \end{array} \]
    
    As programmers designing this system, we would have to consider the
    effects of each of these 20 orderings and check that each behavior is
    acceptable.  Such an approach rapidly becomes unwieldy as the numbers
    of processes and events increase.

    A more practical approach to the design of concurrent systems is to
    devise general mechanisms that allow us to constrain the interleaving
    of concurrent processes so that we can be sure that the program
    behavior is correct.  Many mechanisms have been developed for this
    purpose.  In this section, we describe one of them, the <EM>
    serializer</EM>.

    Serializing access to shared state
  </h2></div>

  

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Serialization implements the following idea: Processes will execute
    concurrently, but there will be certain collections of
    
    functions
    that cannot be executed concurrently.  More precisely, serialization
    creates distinguished sets of
    
    functions
    such that only one execution of a
    
    function
    in each serialized set is permitted to happen at a time. If some
    
    function
    in the set is being executed, then a process that
    attempts to execute any
    
    function
    in the set will be forced to wait
    until the first execution has finished.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We can use serialization to control access to shared variables.
    For example, if we want to update a shared variable based on the
    previous value of that variable, we put the access to the previous
    value of the variable and the assignment of the new value to the
    variable in the same
    
    function.
    We then ensure that no other
    
    function
    that assigns to the variable can run concurrently with this
    
    function
    by serializing all of these
    
    functions
    with the same serializer.  This guarantees that the value of the
    variable cannot be changed between an access and the corresponding
    assignment.

    To make the above mechanism more concrete, suppose that we have
    extended 
    
    JavaScript
    to include a
    
    function
    called 
    
    
      
      
        <kbd>parallel_execute</kbd>:
      
    

    <kbd class='snippet'>
      
      
parallel_execute( f$_{1}$, f$_{2}$, $\ldots$, f$_{k}$ )

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
      
      
        Each f must be a function of no arguments.  
        The function <kbd>parallel_execute</kbd>
        creates a separate process for each
        f, which applies
        f (to no arguments).
      
    
    These processes all
    run concurrently.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>

  <div class='permalink'>

    As an example of how this is used, consider
    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_1_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
let x = 10;

parallel_execute( () => { x = x * x; },

    This creates two concurrent
    processesâ€”$P_1$, which
    sets <kbd>x</kbd> to
    <kbd>x</kbd> times <kbd>x</kbd>,
    and $P_2$, which increments
    <kbd>x</kbd>.  After execution is complete,
    <kbd>x</kbd> will be left with one of five possible
    values, depending on the interleaving of the events of
    $P_1$ and $P_2$:
    <UL>
      <LI>
      101: $P_1$
      sets <kbd>x</kbd> to 100 and then
      $P_2$ increments
      <kbd>x</kbd> to 101.
      </LI>
      <LI>
      121: $P_2$ increments <kbd>x</kbd> to 11 and then
      $P_1$ sets <kbd>x</kbd> to
      <kbd>x</kbd> times <kbd>x</kbd>.
      </LI>
      <LI>
      110: $P_2$ changes
      <kbd>x</kbd> from 10 to 11 between the two
      times that $P_1$ accesses the value of
      <kbd>x</kbd> during the evaluation of
      <kbd>x * x</kbd>.
      </LI>
      <LI>
      11:  $P_2$ accesses <kbd>x</kbd>, then
      $P_1$ sets <kbd>x</kbd> to 100,
      then $P_2$ sets <kbd>x</kbd>.
      </LI>
      <LI>
      100: $P_1$ accesses <kbd>x</kbd> (twice),
      then $P_2$ sets <kbd>x</kbd> to 11,
      then $P_1$ sets <kbd>x</kbd>.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    We can constrain the concurrency by using serialized
    
    functions,
    which are created by <EM>serializers</EM>. Serializers are constructed by
    
      
      <kbd>make_serializer</kbd>,
      
    
    whose implementation is given below.  A serializer takes a
    
    function
    as argument and returns a serialized
    
    function
    that behaves like the original
    
    function.
    All calls to a given serializer return serialized
    
    functions
    in the same set.

    Thus, in contrast to the example above, executing
    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_2_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
let x = 10;

const s = make_serializer();

parallel_execute(s( () => { x = x * x; }),
                 s( () => { x = x + 1; } ));
</pre></div></div>
    can produce only two possible values for
    <kbd>x</kbd>, 101 or 121.
    The other possibilities are eliminated, because the execution of
    $P_1$ and
    $P_2$ cannot be interleaved.

    Here is a version of the
    
    <kbd>make_account</kbd>
    
    
    
    function
    from section \ref{sec:local-state-variables},
    where the deposits and withdrawals have been serialized:
    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_3_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_account(balance) {
    function withdraw(amount) {
        if (balance > amount) {

            return balance;
        } else {
            return "Insufficient funds";
        }
    }
    function deposit(amount) {
        balance = balance + amount;
        return balance;
    }
    const protector = make_serializer();
    function dispatch(m) {
        return m === "withdraw"
               ? protector(withdraw)
               : m === "deposit"

                           m);

    return dispatch;
}

  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
    With this implementation, two processes cannot be withdrawing from or
    depositing into a single account concurrently.  This eliminates the source
    of the error illustrated in figure \ref{fig:bank-access},
    where Peter changes the account balance between the times when Paul accesses
    the balance to compute the new value and when Paul actually performs the
    assignment.  On the other hand, each account has its own serializer,
    so that deposits and withdrawals for different accounts can proceed
    concurrently.

            }

  because allowing unserialized access to the bank balance can

\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

    Ben Bitdiddle suggests that it's a waste of time to
    create a new serialized
    
    function
    in response to every <kbd>withdraw</kbd> and
    <kbd>deposit</kbd> message.  He says that
    
    <kbd>make_account</kbd>
    could be changed so that the calls to
    
      
      
        <kbd>protected_</kbd>
      
    
    are done outside the <kbd>dispatch</kbd>
    
    function.
    That is, an account would return the same serialized
    
    function
    (which was created at the same time as the account) each time
    it is asked for a withdrawal
    
    function.
    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_8_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_account(balance) {
    function withdraw(amount) {
        if (balance > amount) {
            balance = balance - amount;
            return balance;
        } else {
            return "Insufficient funds";
        }
    }
    function deposit(amount) {
        balance = balance + amount;
        return balance;
    }
    const protected_ = make_serializer();
    const protected_withdraw = protected_(withdraw);
    const protected_deposit = protected_(deposit);
    function dispatch(m) {
        return m === "withdraw"
               ? protected_withdraw
               : m === "deposit"
                 ? protected_deposit
                 : m === "balance"
                   ? balance
                   : error("Unknown request in make_account",
                           m);
    }
    return dispatch;
}
</pre></div></div>

    Is this a safe change to make?  In particular, is there any
    difference in what concurrency is allowed by these two versions
    of
    
    <kbd>make_account</kbd>
    ?

    Complexity of using multiple shared resources

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Serializers provide a powerful abstraction that helps isolate the
    complexities of concurrent programs so that they can be dealt with
    carefully and (hopefully) correctly.  However, while using serializers
    is relatively straightforward when there is only a single shared
    resource (such as a single bank account), concurrent programming can
    be treacherously difficult when there are multiple shared resources.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p14' class='permalink'></a><p>
    To illustrate one of the difficulties that can arise, suppose we wish to swap
    the balances in two bank accounts.  We access each account to find the
    balance, compute the difference between the balances, withdraw this
    difference from one account, and deposit it in the other account.  We
    could implement this as
    follows:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_9_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function exchange(account1, account2) {
    const difference = account1("balance") - account2("balance");
    account1("withdraw")(difference);
    account2("deposit")(difference);
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p15' class='permalink'></a><p>
    This
    function
    works well when only a single process is trying to do
    the exchange.  Suppose, however, that Peter and Paul both have access
    to accounts $a_1$, $a_2$,
    and $a_3$, and that
    Peter exchanges $a_1$ and
    $a_2$ while Paul concurrently exchanges
    $a_1$ and $a_3$.
    Even with account deposits and withdrawals
    serialized for individual accounts (as in the
    
    <kbd>make_account</kbd>
    
    
    function
    shown above in this section),
    <kbd>exchange</kbd> can still
    produce incorrect results.  For example, Peter might compute the
    difference in the balances for
    $a_1$ and $a_2$, but then Paul
    might change the balance in $a_1$ before Peter is able
    to complete the exchange.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>
    For correct behavior, we must arrange for the <kbd>exchange</kbd>
    function
    to lock out any other concurrent accesses to the accounts during the
    entire time of the exchange.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p16' class='permalink'></a><p>
    One way we can accomplish this is by using both accounts' serializers
    to serialize the entire <kbd>exchange</kbd>
    
    function.
    To do this, we will arrange for access to an account's serializer.
    Note that we are deliberately
    breaking the modularity of the bank-account object by exposing the
    serializer.  The following version of
    
    <kbd>make_account</kbd>
    
    is identical to the original version given in
    Section \ref{sec:local-state-variables}, except that a serializer is
    provided to protect the balance variable, and the serializer is
    exported via message passing:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_10_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_account_and_serializer(balance) {
    function withdraw(amount) {
        if (balance > amount) {
            balance = balance - amount;
        } else {
            "Insufficient funds";
        }
    }
    function deposit(amount) {
        balance = balance + amount;
        return balance;
    }
    const balance_serializer = make_serializer();
    function dispatch(m) {
        if (m === "withdraw") {
            return withdraw;
        } else if (m === "deposit") {
            return deposit;
        } else if (m === "balance") {
            return balance;
        } else if (m === "serializer") {
            return balance_serializer;
        } else {
            return "Unknown request - - MAKE-ACCOUNT";
        }
    }
    return dispatch;
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p17' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We can use this to do serialized deposits and withdrawals.  However,
    unlike our earlier serialized account, it is now the responsibility of
    each user of bank-account objects to explicitly manage the
    serialization, for example as
    follows:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_11_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function deposit(account, amount) {
    const s = account("serializer");
    const d = account("deposit");
    s(d(amount));
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p18' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Exporting the serializer in this way gives us enough flexibility to
    implement a serialized exchange program.  We simply
    serialize the original
    <kbd>exchange</kbd>
    
    function
    with the serializers for both accounts:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_12_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function serialized_exchange(account1, account2) {
    const serializer1 = account1("serializer");
    const serializer2 = account2("serializer");
    serializer1(serializer2(exchange))(account1, account2);
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

    Suppose that the balances in three accounts start out as \$10, \$20,

    after any number of concurrent exchanges, the account balances should be 
    \$10, \$20, and \$30 in some order.
    Draw a timing diagram like the one in Figure \ref{fig:bank-access} to
    show how this condition can be violated if the exchanges are
    implemented using the first version of the account-exchange program in
    this section.  On the other hand, argue that even with this
    <kbd>exchange</kbd> program, the sum of the balances
    in the accounts will be preserved.  Draw a timing diagram to show how
    even this condition would be violated if we did not serialize the
    transactions on individual accounts.

\begin{Exercise}

    Louis Reasoner thinks our bank-account system is unnecessarily complex
    and error-prone now that deposits and withdrawals aren't
    automatically serialized. He suggests that
    
      
      
        <kbd>make_account_and_serializer</kbd>
      
    
    should have exported the serializer 
    
      
      
        (for use by such functions as
        <kbd>serialized_exchange</kbd>)        
      
    
    in addition to (rather than instead of) using it to serialize accounts and
    deposits as
    
    <kbd>make_account</kbd>
    
    did. He proposes to redefine accounts as follows:
    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_14_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_account_and_serializer(balance) {
    function withdraw(amount) {
        if (balance > amount) {
            balance = balance - amount;
        } else {
            "Insufficient funds";
        }
    }
    function deposit(amount) {
        balance = balance + amount;
        return balance;
    }
    const balance_serializer = make_serializer();
    function dispatch(m) {
        return m === "withdraw"
               ? balance_serializer(withdraw)
               : m === "deposit"
                 ? balance_serializer(deposit)
                 : m === "balance"
                   ? balance
                   : m === "serializer"
                     ? balance_serializer
                     : error("Unknown request in make_account",
                             m);
    }
    return dispatch;
}
</pre></div></div>

    Then deposits are handled as with the original
    
    <kbd>make_account</kbd>:
    
    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_15_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function deposit(account, amount) {
    account("deposit")(amount);
}
</pre></div></div>
    Explain what is wrong with Louis's reasoning.  In particular,
    consider what happens when
    
    <kbd>serialized_exchange</kbd>
    
    is called.

    Implementing serializers
  </h2></div>

  

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p19' class='permalink'></a><p>
    We implement serializers in terms of a more primitive synchronization
    mechanism called a 
    
    <EM>mutex</EM>.  A mutex is an object that supports
    two operationsâ€”the mutex can be 
    
    <EM>acquired</EM>, and the mutex can be
    
    <EM>released</EM>.  Once a mutex has been acquired, no other acquire
    operations on that mutex may proceed until the mutex is
    released.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-5' href='#footnote-5'>[5]</a>
    In our implementation, each serializer has an associated mutex.  Given a
    
    function
    <kbd>p</kbd>, the serializer returns a
    
    function
    that acquires the mutex, runs <kbd>p</kbd>,
    and then releases the mutex.  This ensures that only one of the
    
    functions
    produced by the serializer can be running at once, which is
    precisely the serialization property that we need to guarantee.

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_16_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_serializer() {
    const mutex = make_mutex();
    return p => {
        function serialized_p(args) {
            mutex("acquire");
            const val = p(args);
            mutex("release");
            return val;
        }
        return serialized_p;   
    };
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p20' class='permalink'></a><p>
    The mutex is a mutable object (here we'll use a one-element
    list, which we'll refer to as a 
    
    <EM>cell</EM>) that can hold the value
    true or false.  When the value is false, the mutex is available to be
    acquired.  When the value is true, the mutex is unavailable, and any
    process that attempts to acquire the mutex must wait.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p21' class='permalink'></a><p>
    Our mutex constructor
    
    <kbd>make_mutex</kbd>
    
    begins by initializing the cell
    contents to false.  To acquire the mutex, we test the cell.  If the
    mutex is available, we set the cell contents to true and proceed.
    Otherwise, we wait in a loop, attempting to acquire over and over
    again, until we find that the mutex is
    available.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-6' href='#footnote-6'>[6]</a>
    To release the mutex, we set the cell contents to false.

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_17_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_mutex() {
    const cell = list(false);
    function the_mutex(m) {
        return m === "aquire"
               ? ( test_and_set(cell)
                   ? the_mutex("aquire") // retry
                   : true )
               : m === "release"
                 ? clear(cell)
                 : error("Unknown request in mutex",
                         m);
    }
    return the_mutex;
}
function clear(cell) {
    set_head(cell, false);
}
</pre></div></div>
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p22' class='permalink'></a><p>
    
      
      The function <kbd>test_and_set</kbd>
      
    
    tests the cell and returns the result of the
    test.  In addition, if the test was false,
    
    <kbd>test_and_set</kbd>
    
    sets the cell contents to true before returning false.  We can express this
    behavior as the following
    
    function:

    <div class='snippet' id='javascript_64_18_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function test_and_set(cell) {
    if (head(cell)) {

    }

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p23' class='permalink'></a><p>
    However, this implementation of
    
    <kbd>test_and_set</kbd>
    does not suffice as it stands.  There is a crucial subtlety here, which is the
    essential place where concurrency control enters the system: The
    
    <kbd>test_and_set</kbd>
    
    operation must be performed 
    
    <EM>atomically</EM>. That is, we must guarantee that, once a process has tested
    the cell and found it to be false, the cell contents will actually be set to true
    before any other process can test the cell.  If we do not make this
    guarantee, then the mutex can fail in a way similar to the
    bank-account failure in Figure \ref{fig:bank-access}.  (See
    exercise \ref{ex:atomic-test-and-set}.)

  <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p24' class='permalink'></a><p>
    The actual implementation of
    
    <kbd>test_and_set</kbd>
    
    depends on the details of how our system runs concurrent processes.
    For example, we might be executing concurrent processes on a sequential
    processor using a 
    
    time-slicing mechanism that cycles through the processes,
    permitting each process to run for a short time before interrupting it
    and moving on to the next process.  In that case,
    
      
      
        <kbd>test_and_set</kbd>
      
    
    can work by disabling time slicing during the testing and
    setting.
    
	
    
  Alternatively, multiprocessing computers provide instructions that
  support atomic operations directly in
  hardware.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-7' href='#footnote-7'>[7]</a>

    Now that we have seen how to implement serializers, we can see
    that account exchanging still has a problem, even with the
    
      
      <kbd>serialized_exchange</kbd>
      
    
    
    function
    above.
    Imagine that Peter attempts to exchange $a_1$
    with $a_2$ while Paul concurrently attempts to
    exchange $a_2$
    with $a_1$.
    Suppose that Peter's process reaches the point where
    it has entered a serialized
    
    function
    protecting $a_1$ and, just
    after that, Paul's process enters a serialized
    
    function
    protecting
    $a_2$.  Now Peter cannot proceed (to
    enter a serialized
    
    function
    protecting $a_2$) until Paul exits
    the serialized
    
    function
    protecting $a_2$.  Similarly, Paul
    cannot proceed until Peter exits the serialized
    
    function
    protecting $a_1$.  Each process is
    stalled forever, waiting for the other.  This situation is
    called a <EM>deadlock</EM>.  Deadlock is always a danger in systems
    that provide concurrent access to multiple shared resources.
  </p></div>

  <div class='permalink'>

    One way to avoid the deadlock in this situation is to give each
    account a unique identification number and rewrite
    
      
      <kbd>serialized_exchange</kbd>
    
    so that a process will always attempt to enter a
    
    function
    protecting the
    lowest-numbered account first.  Although this method works well for
    the exchange problem, there are other situations that require more
    sophisticated deadlock-avoidance techniques, or where deadlock cannot
    be avoided at all.  (See exercises \ref{ex:deadlock-avoid}

    The problematic aspects of shared state also arise
    in large, distributed systems.  For

    local values for bank balances and periodically compare these with
    values maintained by other branches.  In such a system the value of
    <QUOTE>the account balance</QUOTE> would be undetermined, except right after

    If Peter deposits money in an account he holds

    changedâ€”when the balance in the local branch changes, or not until
    after the synchronization?  
    And if Paul accesses the account from a

    The only thing that might matter for
    correctness is the behavior observed by Peter and Paul individually

    Questions about the
    <QUOTE>real</QUOTE> account balance or the order of events between

    The basic phenomenon here is that synchronizing different processes,
    establishing shared state, or imposing an order on events requires
    communication among the processes.  In essence, any notion of time in
    concurrency control must be intimately tied to
    communication.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-11' href='#footnote-11'>[11]</a>
    It is intriguing that a similar connection between time and

    fastest signal that can be used to synchronize events) is a
    fundamental constant relating time and space.  The
    complexities we encounter in dealing with time and state in our
