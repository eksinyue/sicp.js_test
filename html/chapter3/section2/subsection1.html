        The overall specification of how the interpreter evaluates an
        application combination remains the same as when we first introduced it in
        section~\ref{sec:substitution-model}:
              <UL>
                <LI>
              To evaluate an application combination of the form
              
\begin{JavaScript}
$\textit{function-expression}$ ( $\textit{argument-expressions}$ )
\end{JavaScript}

              do the following:
              
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Evaluate the function expression 
		of the application
		combination, resulting in the function to be applied.}
\item{Evaluate the argument expressions of the combination.}
\item{Apply the function to the arguments.
		}
\end{enumerate}

        The environment model of evaluation replaces the substitution model in
        specifying what it means to apply a compound
        function
        to arguments.

        In the environment model of evaluation, a
        function
        is always a pair
        consisting of some code and a pointer to an environment. 
        Functions
        are created in one way only: by evaluating a
	
	  
	  function definition
		
	expression.
        
        This produces a
        function
        whose code is obtained from the text of the
	
	  
	  function definition
		
	expression and whose environment is the environment in
        which the
	
	  
	  function definition
		
	expression was evaluated to produce the
        function.  For example, consider the
        function declaration
        

        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

        evaluated in the global environment.  The
        function declaration
        syntax
        is just syntactic sugar for an underlying implicit
	
	  
	  function definition
	
        expression.  It would have been equivalent to have used

        
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
const square = x => x * x;
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=4&prgrm=MYewdgzgLgBBCOBXAhgJwKYwLwwB7YD48YAqPAbiA}{\usebox\lstbox}



        which evaluates {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x => x * x$} and binds {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$square$} to the resulting value, all in the global environment.

        Figure~\ref{fig:evaluating-square} shows the result of evaluating this
        function declaration statement.  The
        function
        object is a pair whose code
        specifies that the
        function
        has one formal parameter, namely {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$},
        and a
        function
        body {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$return x * x;$}.  The environment part of the
        function
        is a pointer to the program environment, since that is the
        environment in which the
	function definition
	expression was evaluated to
        produce the
        function. A new binding, which associates the
        function
        object with the symbol {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$square$}, has been added to the program
        frame. 
        
          
          
            The bindings in a frame correspond to the const and let declarations directly nested in that frame.

            The program gives rise to a frame of its own, which we call the <EM>program environment</EM>, directly inside the global frame.
            To reduce clutter, after this figure, we will not display the global environment (as it is always the same), but we are reminded of its
            existence by the pointer from the program environment.

        Now that we have seen how
        functions
        are created, we can describe how
        functions
        are applied.  The environment model specifies: To apply a
        function
        to arguments, create a new environment containing a frame
        that binds the parameters to the values of the arguments.  The
        enclosing environment of this frame is the environment specified by
        the
        function.  Now, within this new environment, evaluate the
        function
        body.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
        To show how this rule is followed, Figure~\ref{fig:square5-eval}
        illustrates the environment structure created by evaluating the
        expression {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$square(5);$} in the program environment, where {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$square$} is the
        function
        generated in
        Figure~\ref{fig:evaluating-square}.  Applying the
        function
        results in
        the creation of a new environment, labeled E1 in the figure, that
        begins with a frame in which {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}, the formal parameter for the
        function, is bound to the argument 5.  The pointer leading upward
        from this frame shows that the frame's enclosing environment is the
        program environment.  The program environment is chosen here, because
        this is the environment that is indicated as part of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$square$}
        function
        object.  Within E1, we evaluate the body of the
        function,
        {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$return x * x;$}.  Since the value of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} in E1 is 5, the result is
        {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$5 * 5$}, or~25.

        The environment model of
        function
        application can be summarized by
        two rules:

        <UL>
          <LI>A
            function
            object is applied to a set of arguments by
            constructing a frame, 
            
	      
	      in which we create variable bindings of the parameters of the function
	    
            to the arguments of the call, and then evaluating the body of
            the
            function
            in the context of the new environment constructed.  The
            new frame has as its enclosing environment the environment part of the
            function
            object being applied.
            
            
          </LI>
          <LI>A
            function
            is created by evaluating a 
	    
	      
	      function definition
	    
            expression relative to a given environment.  The resulting
            function
            object is a pair consisting of the text of the
	    
	      
	      function definition
	    
	    expression
            and a pointer to the environment in which the
            function
            was created.
          </LI>
        </UL>
      </p></div>

        We also specify that defining a symbol using {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$const$}/{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$let$} creates a
        constant/variable binding in the current environment frame and assigns to the symbol the
        indicated value. Finally, we specify the behavior of
        assignment, the operation that forced us to introduce the environment
        model in the first place.
	<SPLIT>
	  
	  
	    Evaluating the
	    statement $\textit{name}$ {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$=$} $\textit{value}${\lstinline[mathescape=true]$;$} in some environment locates the binding of
        the name in the environment.
	For this, one finds the first frame in the environment
        that contains a binding for the name.
	If the name
	is unbound in the environment, then
	the assignment signals a <QUOTE>variable undefined</QUOTE> error.
	Otherwise, if the binding in the frame is a constant binding, the assignment
	signals an <QUOTE>assignment to constant</QUOTE>
	error, because JavaScript forbids assignment
	to constants. At last, if
	the binding in the frame is a variable binding, that binding
	is changed to reflect the new value of the variable.

        These evaluation rules, though considerably more complex than the
        substitution model, are still reasonably straightforward.  Moreover,
        the evaluation model, though abstract, provides a correct description
        of how the interpreter evaluates expressions.  In chapter~4 we shall
        see how this model can serve as a blueprint for implementing a working
        interpreter.  The following sections elaborate the details of the
        model by analyzing some illustrative programs.
