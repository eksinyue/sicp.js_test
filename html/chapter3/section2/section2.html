      When we introduced compound
      functions
      in chapter~1, we used the
      
      substitution model of evaluation
      (section~\ref{sec:substitution-model}) to define what is meant by
      applying a
      function
      to arguments:

      <UL>
        <LI>To apply a compound
          function
          to arguments, evaluate the body of the
          function
          with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding
          argument.
        </LI>
      </UL>

      Once we admit assignment into our programming language, such a
      definition is no longer adequate.  In particular,
      section~\ref{sec:costs-of-assignment} argued that, in the presence of
      assignment, a variable can no longer be considered to be merely a name
      for a value.  Rather, a variable must somehow designate a <QUOTE>place</QUOTE> in
      which values can be stored.  In our new model of evaluation, these
      places will be maintained in structures called 
      
      <EM>environments</EM>.

      An environment is a sequence of 
      
      <EM>frames</EM>.  Each frame is a table
      (possibly empty) of 
      
      <EM>bindings</EM>, which associate variable names with
      their corresponding values.  (A single frame may contain at most one
      binding for any variable.)  Each frame also has a pointer to its 
      
      
      <EM>
        enclosing environment</EM>, unless, for the purposes of discussion, the
      frame is considered to be 
      
      
      <EM>global</EM>.  The 
      
      <EM>value of a variable</EM>
      with respect to an environment is the value given by the binding of
      the variable in the first frame in the environment that contains a
      binding for that variable.  If no frame in the sequence specifies a
      binding for the variable, then the variable is said to be 
      
      
      <EM>
        unbound</EM> in the environment.

      Figure~\ref{fig:environment-structure} shows a simple environment
      structure consisting of three frames, labeled I, II, and III.  In the
      diagram, A, B, C, and D are pointers to environments.  C and D point
      to the same environment.  The variables {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$z$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} are bound
      in frame II, while {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} are bound in frame I.  The
      value of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} in environment D is 3.  The value of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} with
      respect to environment B is also 3.  This is determined as follows: We
      examine the first frame in the sequence (frame III) and do not find a
      binding for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}, so we proceed to the enclosing environment D and
      find the binding in frame I.  On the other hand, the value of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}
      in environment A is 7, because the first frame in the sequence (frame
      II) contains a binding of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} to 7.  With respect to environment
      A, the binding of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} to 7 in frame II is said to 
      
      <EM>shadow</EM> the
      binding of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} to 3 in frame I.

      The environment is crucial to the evaluation process,
      because it determines the context in which an expression should be
      evaluated.  Indeed, one could say that expressions in a programming
      language do not, in themselves, have any meaning.  Rather, an
      expression acquires a meaning only with respect to some environment in
      which it is evaluated.

      Even the interpretation of an expression as
      straightforward as {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$display(1)$} depends on an understanding that one
      is operating in a context in which {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$display$} refers to the primitive function
      that displays a value. Thus, in our model of evaluation we will always speak of evaluating an
      expression with respect to some environment.  To describe interactions
      with the interpreter, we will suppose that there is a 
      
      program
      environment, consisting of a single frame (directly inside the global
      environment) that includes values for the symbols associated with the
      primitive
      functions.  
      For example, the idea that {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$display$} is the
      primitive function for displaying a value is captured by saying that the variable 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$display$} is
      bound in the global environment to the respective primitive 
      function.
