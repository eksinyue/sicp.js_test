      This section provides practice in the use of list structure and data
      abstraction to manipulate sets and trees.  The application is to
      methods for representing data as sequences of ones and zeros (bits).
      For example, the
      
      
      ASCII standard code used to represent text in
      computers encodes each
      
      character as a sequence of seven bits.  Using
      seven bits allows us to distinguish $2^7$, or 128, possible different
      characters.  In general, if we want to distinguish $n$ different
      symbols, we will need to use $\log_2 n$ bits per symbol.  If all our
      messages are made up of the eight symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H,
      we can choose a code with three bits per character, for example
      
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\maxsizebox{\linewidth}{0.8\paperheight}{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{{img\string_tex/ch2\string_3\string_4-1}.png}}
\end{figure}

      With this code, the message
      
\begin{quote}
BACADAEAFABBAAAGAH
      \end{quote}

      is encoded as the string of 54 bits
      
\begin{quote}
001000010000011000100000101000001001000000000110000111
      \end{quote}

      Codes such as ASCII and the A-through-H code above are known as
      
      
      <EM>fixed-length</EM> codes, because they represent each symbol in the message
      with the same number of bits.  It is sometimes advantageous to use
      
      
      <EM>variable-length</EM> codes, in which different symbols may be
      represented by different numbers of bits.  For example,
      
      
      Morse code
      does not use the same number of dots and dashes for each letter of the
      alphabet.  In particular, E, the most frequent letter, is represented
      by a single dot.  In general, if our messages are such that some
      symbols appear very frequently and some very rarely, we can encode
      data more efficiently (i.e., using fewer bits per message) if we
      assign shorter codes to the frequent symbols.  Consider the following
      alternative code for the letters A through H:

      
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\maxsizebox{\linewidth}{0.8\paperheight}{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{{img\string_tex/ch2\string_3\string_4-2}.png}}
\end{figure}


      With this code, the same message as above is encoded as the string
      
\begin{quote}
100010100101101100011010100100000111001111
      \end{quote}

      This string contains 42 bits, so it saves more than 20% in space in
      comparison with the fixed-length code shown above.
      </p></div>

      One of the difficulties of using a variable-length code is knowing
      when you have reached the end of a symbol in reading a sequence of
      zeros and ones.  Morse code solves this problem by using a special
      
      <EM>separator code</EM> (in this case, a pause) after the sequence of
      dots and dashes for each letter.  Another solution is to design the
      code in such a way that no complete code for any symbol is the
      beginning (or <EM>prefix</EM>) of the code for another symbol.  Such a
      code is called a
      
      
      <EM>prefix code</EM>.  In the example above, A is
      encoded by 0 and B is encoded by 100, so no other symbol can have a
      code that begins with 0 or with 100.
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
      In general, we can attain significant savings if we use
      variable-length prefix codes that take advantage of the relative
      frequencies of the symbols in the messages to be encoded.  One
      particular scheme for doing this is called the Huffman encoding
      method, after its discoverer,
      
      David Huffman.  A Huffman code can be
      represented as a
      
      
      binary tree whose leaves are the symbols that are
      encoded.  At each non-leaf node of the tree there is a set containing
      all the symbols in the leaves that lie below the node.  In addition,
      each symbol at a leaf is assigned a weight (which is its
      relative frequency), and each non-leaf
      node contains a weight that is the sum of all the weights of the
      leaves lying below it.  The weights are not used in the encoding or
      the decoding process.  We will see below how they are used to help
      construct the tree.

\caption{A Huffman encoding tree.}
\label{fig:huffman}
\end{figure}

      Figure~\ref{fig:huffman} shows the Huffman tree for the A-through-H
      code given above.  The weights at the leaves
      indicate that the tree was designed for messages in which A appears
      with relative frequency 8, B with relative frequency 3, and the
      other letters each with relative frequency 1.
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
      Given a Huffman tree, we can find the encoding of any symbol by
      starting at the root and moving down until we reach the leaf that
      holds the symbol.  Each time we move down a left branch we add a 0 to
      the code, and each time we move down a right branch we add a 1.  (We
      decide which branch to follow by testing to see which branch either is
      the leaf node for the symbol or contains the symbol in its set.)  For
      example, starting from the root of the tree in
      Figure~\ref{fig:huffman}, we arrive at the leaf for D by following a
      right branch, then a left branch, then a right branch, then a right
      branch; hence, the code for D is 1011.
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
      To decode a bit sequence using a Huffman tree, we begin at the root
      and use the successive zeros and ones of the bit sequence to determine
      whether to move down the left or the right branch.  Each time we come
      to a leaf, we have generated a new symbol in the message, at which
      point we start over from the root of the tree to find the next symbol.
      For example, suppose we are given the tree above and the sequence
      10001010.  Starting at the root, we move down the right branch, (since
      the first bit of the string is~1), then down the left branch (since
      the second bit is~0), then down the left branch (since the third bit
      is also~0).  This brings us to the leaf for~B, so the first symbol of
      the decoded message is~B.  Now we start again at the root, and we make
      a left move because the next bit in the string is~0.  This brings us
      to the leaf for~A.  Then we start again at the root with the rest of
      the string 1010, so we move right, left, right, left and reach~C.
      Thus, the entire message is BAC.

        Generating Huffman trees
      

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
      Given an <QUOTE>alphabet</QUOTE> of symbols and their relative frequencies, how
      do we construct the <QUOTE>best</QUOTE> code?  (In other words, which tree will
      encode messages with the fewest bits?)  Huffman gave an algorithm for
      doing this and showed that the resulting code is indeed the best
      variable-length code for messages where the relative frequency of the
      symbols matches the frequencies with which the code was constructed.
      
      
      We will not prove this optimality of Huffman codes here, but we will
      show how Huffman trees are constructed.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
      The algorithm for generating a Huffman tree is very simple. The idea
      is to arrange the tree so that the symbols with the lowest frequency
      appear farthest away from the root. Begin with the set of leaf nodes,
      containing symbols and their frequencies, as determined by the initial data
      from which the code is to be constructed. Now find two leaves with
      the lowest weights and merge them to produce a node that has these
      two nodes as its left and right branches. The weight of the new node
      is the sum of the two weights. Remove the two leaves from the
      original set and replace them by this new node. Now continue this
      process. At each step, merge two nodes with the smallest weights,
      removing them from the set and replacing them with a node that has
      these two as its left and right branches. The process stops when
      there is only one node left, which is the root of the entire tree.
      Here is how the Huffman tree of Figure~\ref{fig:huffman} was generated:
      <SPLIT>
        
        


      
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\maxsizebox{\linewidth}{0.8\paperheight}{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{{img\string_tex/ch2\string_3\string_4-3}.png}}
\end{figure}


        
      </SPLIT>
      The algorithm does not always specify a unique tree, because there may
      not be unique smallest-weight nodes at each step.  Also, the choice of
      the order in which the two nodes are merged (i.e., which will be the
      right branch and which will be the left branch) is arbitrary.

      In the exercises below we will work with a system that uses
      Huffman trees to encode and decode messages and generates Huffman
      trees according to the algorithm outlined above.  We will begin by
      discussing how trees are represented.
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
      Leaves of the tree are represented by a list consisting of the
      symbol {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$leaf$}, the symbol at the leaf, and the weight:

      
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function make_leaf(symbol, weight) {
   return list("leaf", symbol, weight);

function is_leaf(object) {

      A general tree will be a list of a left branch, a right branch, a set
      of symbols, and a weight.  The set of symbols will be simply a list of
      the symbols, rather than some more sophisticated set representation.
      When we make a tree by merging two nodes, we obtain the weight of the
      tree as the sum of the weights of the nodes, and the set of symbols as
      the union of the sets of symbols for the nodes.  Since our symbol sets are
      represented as lists, we can form the union by using the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$append$}
      function
      we defined in section~\ref{sec:sequences}:

      
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
function make_code_tree(left,right) {
    return list(left,
                right,
                append(symbols(left), symbols(right)),
                weight(left) + weight(right));
}
\end{JavaScriptClickable}

      If we make a tree in this way, we have the following selectors:

      
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}

      The

      <EM>generic

      In our representation of trees, each non-leaf node contains a set of

      with sets of leaves and trees, successively merging the two smallest

We have an alphabet of $n = 8$ symbols,    
and a message of $m = 36$ symbols.
Then the minimum number of bits to encode a specific symbol using a fixed-length
code is $\lceil \log_2{n} \rceil = 3$. Thus
the minimum number of bits to encode all the lyrics is 
$m \lceil \log_2{n} \rceil = 36 \times 3 = 108$.

Consider the special case in exercise~\ref{ex:encode-symbol}.
At each step down the
path of length $n$, we need to do a linear
search in a list of length $n, n-1, \ldots, 1$.
In the worst case, there are $O(n \times n / 2) = O(n^2)$
number of steps.
