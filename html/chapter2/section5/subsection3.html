      The manipulation of symbolic algebraic expressions is a complex
      process that illustrates many of the hardest problems that occur in
      the design of large-scale systems.  An algebraic expression, in
      
      general, can be viewed as a hierarchical structure, a tree of
      operators applied to operands.  We can construct algebraic expressions
      by starting with a set of primitive objects, such as constants and
      variables, and combining these by means of algebraic operators, such
      as addition and multiplication.  As in other languages, we form
      abstractions that enable us to refer to compound objects in simple
      terms.  Typical abstractions in symbolic algebra are ideas such as
      linear combination, polynomial, rational function, or trigonometric
      function.  We can regard these as compound <QUOTE>types,</QUOTE> which are often
      useful for directing the processing of expressions.  For example, we
      could describe the expression

      
        \[ x^{2}\, \sin (y^2+1)+x\, \cos 2y+\cos (y^3 -2y^2) \]
      
      as a polynomial in $x$ with coefficients that are trigonometric
      functions of polynomials in $y$ whose coefficients are integers.

      We will not attempt to develop a complete algebraic-manipulation
      system here.  Such systems are exceedingly complex programs, embodying
      deep algebraic knowledge and elegant algorithms.  What we will do is
      look at a simple but important part of algebraic manipulation: the
      arithmetic of polynomials.  We will illustrate the kinds of decisions
      the designer of such a system faces, and how to apply the ideas of
      abstract data and generic operations to help organize this effort.

        Arithmetic on polynomials
      

      
      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
      Our first task in designing a system for performing arithmetic on
      polynomials is to decide just what a polynomial is.  Polynomials are
      normally defined relative to certain variables (the 
      
      
      <EM>
        indeterminates</EM> of the polynomial).  For simplicity, we will restrict
      ourselves to polynomials having just one indeterminate (
      
      
      <EM>
        univariate polynomials</EM>).<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
        \[ 5x^2 +3x +7 \]
      
      is a simple polynomial in $x$, and
      
        \[ (y^2 +1)x^3 +(2y)x+1 \]
      
      is a polynomial in $x$ whose coefficients are polynomials in $y$.
       We will define a polynomial to be a
      sum of terms, each of which is either a coefficient, a power of the
      indeterminate, or a product of a coefficient and a power of the
      indeterminate.  A coefficient is defined as an algebraic expression
      that is not dependent upon the indeterminate of the polynomial.  For
      example,
      
        \[ 5x^2 +3x +7 \]
      
      is a simple polynomial in $x$, and
      
        \[ (y^2 +1)x^3 +(2y)x+1 \]
      
      is a polynomial in $x$ whose coefficients are polynomials in $y$.
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
      Already we are skirting some thorny issues.  Is the first of these
      polynomials the same as the polynomial $5y^2 +3y +7$, or not?  A
      reasonable answer might be <QUOTE>yes, if we are considering a polynomial
        purely as a mathematical function, but no, if we are considering a
        polynomial to be a syntactic form.</QUOTE>  The second polynomial is
      algebraically equivalent to a polynomial in $y$ whose coefficients are
      polynomials in $x$.  Should our system recognize this, or not?
      Furthermore, there are other ways to represent a polynomialâ€”for
      example, as a product of factors, or (for a univariate polynomial) as
      the set of roots, or as a listing of the values of the polynomial at a
      specified set of points.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a><QUOTE>polynomial</QUOTE> will be a
      particular syntactic form, not its underlying mathematical meaning.
      
      We can finesse these questions by deciding that in our
      algebraic-manipulation system a <QUOTE>polynomial</QUOTE> will be a
      particular syntactic form, not its underlying mathematical meaning.

      Now we must consider how to go about doing arithmetic on polynomials.
      In this simple system, we will consider only addition and
      multiplication.  Moreover, we will insist that two polynomials to be
      combined must have the same indeterminate.

      We will approach the design of our system by following the familiar
      discipline of data abstraction.  We will represent polynomials using a
      data structure called a 
      
      <EM>poly</EM>, which consists of a variable and a
      
      collection of terms.  We assume that we have selectors {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$variable$}
      and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$term_list$} that extract those parts from a poly and
      a constructor {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_poly$} that assembles a
      poly from a given variable and a term list.
      A variable will be just a symbol, so we can use the 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$is_same_variable$}
      function
      of section~\ref{sec:symbolic-differentiation} to compare variables.
      
      
      The following
      functions
      define addition and multiplication of polys:

      
\begin{JavaScript}
function add_poly(p1, p2) {
    return is_same_variable(variable(p1), variable(p2))
           ? make_poly(variable(p1),
                       add_terms(term_list(p1),
                                 term_list(p2)))
           : Error("Polys not in same var in add_poly",
                   list(p1, p2));
}
function mul_poly(p1, p2) {
    return is_same_variable(variable(p1), variable(p2))
           ? make_poly(variable(p1),
                       mul_terms(term_list(p1),
                                 term_list(p2)))
           : Error("Polys not in same var in mul_poly",
                   list(p1, p2));
}
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
      To incorporate polynomials into our generic arithmetic system, we need
      to supply them with type tags.  We'll use the tag {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$"polynomial"$},
      and install appropriate operations on tagged polynomials in
      the operation table.  We'll embed all our code
      in an installation
      function
      for the polynomial package,
      similar to the ones in
      section~\ref{sec:generic-arithmetic-operators}:
      
      
      

      
\begin{JavaScript}
function install_polynomial_package() {
    // internal functions
    // representation of poly
    function make_poly(variable, term_list) {
        return pair(variable, term_list);
    }
    function variable(p) { return head(p); }
    function term_list(p) { return tail(p); }
    //   functions is_same_variable and
    //   is_variable from section 2.3.2
    // representation of terms and term lists
    //   functions adjoin_term ...coeff from text below

    function add_poly(p1, p2) {
        ...
    }
    //   functions used by add_poly
    function mul_poly(p1, p2) {
        ...
    }
    //   functions used by mul_poly
    // interface to rest of the system
    function tag(p) {
        return attach_tag("polynomial", p);
    }
    put("add", list("polynomial", "polynomial"),
        (p1, p2) => tag(add_poly(p1, p2)));
    put("mul", list("polynomial", "polynomial"),
        (p1, p2) => tag(mul_poly(p1, p2)));
    put("make", list("polynomial"),
        (variable, terms) =>
            tag(make_poly(variable, terms)));
    return "done";
}
\end{JavaScript}

      Polynomial addition is performed termwise.  Terms of the same order
      (i.e., with the same power of the indeterminate) must be combined.
      This is done by forming a new term of the same order whose coefficient
      is the sum of the coefficients of the addends.  Terms in one addend
      for which there are no terms of the same order in the other addend are
      simply accumulated into the sum polynomial being constructed.

      In order to manipulate term lists, we will assume that we have a
      constructor 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$the_empty_termlist$} that returns an empty term list
      and a constructor 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$adjoin_term$} that adjoins a new term to a term
      list.  We will also assume that we have a predicate 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$is_empty_termlist$} that tells if a given term list is empty, a selector
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$first_term$} that extracts the highest-order term from a term
      list, and a selector 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rest_terms$} that returns all but the highest-order
      term.  To manipulate terms, we will suppose that we have a
      constructor 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_term$} that constructs a term with given
      order and coefficient, and selectors 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$order$} and 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$coeff$} that return, respectively, the order and the
      coefficient of the term.  These operations allow us to consider both
      terms and term lists as data abstractions, whose concrete
      representations we can worry about separately.

      Here is the
      function
      that constructs the term list for the sum of two
      polynomials:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
function add_terms(L1, L2) {
    if (is_empty_termlist(L1)) {
      return L2;

      }
    }
}
\end{JavaScript}


      The most important point to note here is that we used the generic
      addition
      function
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$add$} to add together the coefficients of the
      terms being combined.  This has powerful consequences, as we will see

      In order to multiply two term lists, we multiply each term of the
      first list by all the terms of the other list, repeatedly using
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul_term_by_all_terms$}
      , which multiplies a given term by
      all terms in a given term list.  The resulting term lists (one for
      each term of the first list) are accumulated into a sum.  Multiplying
      two terms forms a term whose order is the sum of the orders of the
      factors and whose coefficient is the product of the coefficients of
      the factors:

      
\begin{JavaScript}
function mul_terms(L1, L2) {

      This is really all there is to polynomial addition and multiplication.
      
      
      Notice that, since we operate on terms using the generic
      functions
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$add$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul$}, our polynomial package is automatically able
      to handle any type of coefficient that is known about by the generic
      arithmetic package.  If we include a 
      
      coercion mechanism such as one of
      those discussed in section~\ref{sec:combining-data-of-different-types},
      then we also are automatically able to handle operations on
      polynomials of different coefficient types, such as
      
        \[ 
        {\left[3x^2 +(2+3i)x+7\right] \cdot \left[x^4 +\frac{2}{3}x^2
        +(5+3i)\right]}
        \]
      

      Because we installed the polynomial addition and
      multiplication
      functions
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$add_poly$}
       and 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul_poly$}
       in the generic
      arithmetic system as the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$add$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul$} operations
      for type {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$polynomial$}, our system is also
      automatically able to handle polynomial operations such as
      
        \[
        {\left[ (y+1)x^2 +(y^2 +1)x+(y-1)\right]\cdot \left[(y-2)
        x+(y^3 +7)\right]}
        \]
      
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
      The reason is that when the system tries to combine coefficients, it
      will dispatch through {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$add$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul$}.  Since the coefficients
      are themselves polynomials (in $y$), these will be combined using 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$add_poly$}
       and 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul_poly$}
      .  The result is a kind of 
      
      
      <QUOTE>data-directed recursion</QUOTE> in which, for example, a call to 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul_poly$}
       will result
      in recursive calls to 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul_poly$}
       in order to multiply the
      coefficients.  If the coefficients of the coefficients were themselves
      polynomials (as might be used to represent polynomials in three
      variables), the data direction would ensure that the system would
      follow through another level of recursive calls, and so on through as
      many levels as the structure of the data dictates.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>

      \subsubsection{
        Representing term lists
      

      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
      Finally, we must confront the job of implementing a good
      representation for term lists.  A term list is, in effect, a set of
      coefficients keyed by the order of the term.  Hence, any of the
      methods for representing sets, as discussed in
      section~\ref{sec:representing-sets}, can be applied to this task.  On
      the other hand, our
      functions
      
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$add_terms$}
       and 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul_terms$}
       always
      access term lists sequentially from highest to lowest order.  Thus, we
      will use some kind of ordered list representation.
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p14' class='permalink'></a><p>
      How should we structure the list that represents a term list?  One
      consideration is the <QUOTE>density</QUOTE> of the polynomials we intend to
      manipulate.  A polynomial is said to be 
      
      
      <EM>dense</EM> if it has nonzero
      coefficients in terms of most orders.  If it has many zero terms it
      is said to be 
      
      
      <EM>sparse</EM>.  For example,
      
        \[ A:\quad x^5 +2x^4 +3x^2 -2x -5 \]
      
      is a dense polynomial, whereas
      
        \[ B:\quad x^{100} +2x^2 +1 \]
      
      is sparse.
      </p></div>
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p15' class='permalink'></a><p>
      The term lists of dense polynomials are most efficiently represented
      as lists of the coefficients.  For example, $A$ above would be nicely
      represented as 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(1, 2, 0, 3, -2, -5)$}.  The order of a term in this
      representation is the length of the sublist beginning with that term's
      coefficient, decremented by 1.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-5' href='#footnote-5'>[5]</a>$B$: There would be a giant list of zeros
      punctuated by a few lonely nonzero terms.  A more reasonable
      representation of the term list of a sparse polynomial is as a list of
      the nonzero terms, where each term is a list containing the order of the
      term and the coefficient for that order.  In such a scheme, polynomial
      $B$ is efficiently represented as 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list(100, 1), list(2, 2), list(0, 1))$}.  As
      most polynomial manipulations are performed on sparse polynomials, we
      will use this method.  We will assume that term lists are represented
      as lists of terms, arranged from highest-order to lowest-order term.
      Once we have made this decision, implementing the selectors and
      constructors for terms and term lists is straightforward:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-6' href='#footnote-6'>[6]</a>
\begin{JavaScript}
function adjoin_term(term, term_list) {
    return is_equal_to_zero(coeff(term))
           ? term_list
           : pair(term, term_list);
}
const the_empty_termlist = null;
function first_term(term_list) {
    return head(term_list);
}
function rest_terms(term_list) {
    return tail(term_list);
}
function is_empty_termlist(term_list) {

      This would be a terrible representation for a
      sparse polynomial such as $B$: There would be a giant list of zeros
      punctuated by a few lonely nonzero terms.  A more reasonable
      representation of the term list of a sparse polynomial is as a list of
      the nonzero terms, where each term is a list containing the order of the
      term and the coefficient for that order.  In such a scheme, polynomial
      $B$ is efficiently represented as 
      
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$list(list(100, 1), list(2, 2), list(0, 1))$}.  As
      most polynomial manipulations are performed on sparse polynomials, we
      will use this method.  We will assume that term lists are represented
      as lists of terms, arranged from highest-order to lowest-order term.
      Once we have made this decision, implementing the selectors and
      constructors for terms and term lists is straightforward:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-7' href='#footnote-7'>[7]</a>

        Suppose we want to have a polynomial system that is efficient for both
        sparse and dense polynomials.  One way to do this is to allow both
        kinds of term-list representations in our system.  The situation is
        analogous to the complex-number example of section~\ref{sec:multiple-reps},
        where we allowed both rectangular and polar representations.
        To do this we must distinguish different types of term lists and make
        the operations on term lists generic.  Redesign the polynomial system
        to implement this generalization.  This is a major effort, not a local
        change.

        A univariate polynomial can be divided by another one to produce a
        polynomial quotient and a polynomial remainder.  For example,

        
          \[ \frac{x^5-1}{x^2 -1}=x^3 +x,\text{ remainder }x-1 \]
        


        Division can be performed via long division.
        That is, divide the highest-order term of the dividend by
        the highest-order term of the divisor.  The result is the first term of the
        quotient.  Next, multiply the result by the divisor, subtract that
        from the dividend, and produce the rest of the answer by recursively
        dividing the difference by the divisor.  Stop when the order of the
        divisor exceeds the order of the dividend and declare the dividend to
        be the remainder.  Also, if the dividend ever becomes zero, return
        zero as both quotient and remainder.

        
        We can design a 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$div_poly$}
        function
        on the model of 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$add_poly$}
       and 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$mul_poly$}. The
        function
        checks to see if the two polys have
        the same variable.  If so, 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$div_poly$}
       strips off the variable and
        passes the problem to 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$div_terms$}
      , which performs the division
        operation on term lists. 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$div_poly$}
       finally reattaches the variable
        to the result supplied by 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$div_terms$}
      .  It is convenient
        to design 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$div_terms$}
       to compute both the quotient and the remainder
        of a division.  
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$div_terms$}
       can take two term lists as arguments and
        return a list of the quotient term list and the remainder term list.

        Complete the following definition of 
      {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$div_terms$}
       by filling in the
        missing expressions.  Use this to implement

      Our polynomial system illustrates how objects of one type
      (polynomials) may in fact be complex objects that have objects of many
      different types as parts.  This poses no real difficulty in defining
      generic operations.  We need only install appropriate generic operations
      for performing the necessary manipulations of the parts of the
      compound types.  In fact, we saw that polynomials form a kind of
      <QUOTE>recursive data abstraction,</QUOTE> in that parts of a polynomial may
      themselves be polynomials.  Our generic operations and our
      data-directed programming style can handle this complication without
      much trouble.

<a name='p18' class='permalink'></a><p>
      On the other hand, polynomial algebra is a system for which the data
      types cannot be naturally arranged in a tower.  For instance, it is
      possible to have polynomials in $x$ whose coefficients are polynomials
      in $y$.  It is also possible to have polynomials in $y$ whose
      coefficients are polynomials in $x$.  Neither of these types is
      <QUOTE>above</QUOTE> the other in any natural way, yet it is often necessary to
      add together elements from each set.  There are several ways to do
      this.  One possibility is to convert one polynomial to the type of the
      other by expanding and rearranging terms so that both polynomials have
      the same principal variable.  One can impose a towerlike structure on
      this by ordering the variables and thus always converting any
      polynomial to a 
      
      
      <QUOTE>canonical form</QUOTE> with the highest-priority variable
      dominant and the lower-priority variables buried in the coefficients.
      This strategy works fairly well, except that the conversion may expand
      a polynomial unnecessarily, making it hard to read and perhaps less
      efficient to work with.  The tower strategy is certainly not natural
      for this domain or for any domain where the user can invent new types
      dynamically using old types in various combining forms, such as
      trigonometric functions, power series, and integrals.

      We can solve the problem exhibited in exercise~\ref{ex:gcd-of-polys} if
      we use the following modification of the GCD algorithm (which really
      works only in the case of polynomials with integer coefficients).
      Before performing any polynomial division in the GCD computation, we
      multiply the dividend by an integer constant factor, chosen to
      guarantee that no fractions will arise during the division process.
      Our answer will thus differ from the actual GCD by an integer constant
      factor, but this does not matter in the case of reducing rational
      functions to lowest terms; the GCD will be used to divide both the
      numerator and denominator, so the integer constant factor will cancel

      Thus, here is how to reduce a rational function to lowest terms:

      <UL>
        <LI>Compute the GCD of the numerator and denominator, using
          the version of 
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd_terms$}
             from exercise~\ref{ex:pseudoremainder-terms}.

        </LI>
        <LI>When you obtain the GCD, multiply both numerator and
          denominator by the same integerizing factor before dividing through by
          the GCD, so that division by the GCD will not introduce any noninteger
          coefficients.  As the factor you can use the leading coefficient of
          the GCD raised to the power $1+O_{1} -O_{2}$, where $O_{2}$ is the order of the GCD and $O_{1}$ is the maximum of the orders of the numerator
          and denominator.  This will ensure that dividing the numerator and
          denominator by the GCD will not introduce any fractions.

        </LI>
        <LI>The result of this operation will be a numerator and denominator
          with integer coefficients.  The coefficients will normally be very
          large because of all of the integerizing factors, so the last step is
          to remove the redundant factors by computing the (integer) greatest
          common divisor of all the coefficients of the numerator and the
          denominator and dividing through by this factor.

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item{ Implement this algorithm as a

            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reduce_terms$}
             that takes two
            term lists {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$n$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$d$} as arguments and returns a list {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$nn$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$dd$}, which are {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$n$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$d$} reduced to lowest terms
            via the algorithm given above.
            Also write a

            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reduce_poly$}
             strips off the variable and

            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reduce_terms$}
            , then reattaches the variable
            to the two term lists supplied by 
            
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reduce_terms$}

            that does what the original 
            
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_rat$}
             did for integers:

            
\begin{JavaScript}
function reduce_integers(n, d) {
    const g = gcd(n, d);
    return list(n / g, d / g);
}
\end{JavaScript}


            and define
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reduce$} as a generic operation that calls 
            
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$apply_generic$}
             to dispatch to either 
            
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reduce_poly$}
             (for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$polynomial$} arguments)
            or 
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reduce_integers$}
             (for 
            
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$javascript_number$}
             arguments).
            You can now easily make the
            rational-arithmetic package reduce fractions to lowest terms by
            having 
            {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$make_rat$}
             call {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$reduce$} before combining the given
            numerator and denominator to form a rational number.
            The system now
            handles rational expressions in either integers or polynomials.
            To test your program, try the example at the beginning of this
            extended exercise:

            
\begin{JavaScript}
const p1 = make_polynomial("x", list(make_term(1, 1),
                                     make_term(0, 1)));
const p2 = make_polynomial("x", list(make_term(3, 1),
                                     make_term(0, -1)));
const p3 = make_polynomial("x", list(make_term(1, 1)));
const p4 = make_polynomial("x", list(make_term(2, 1),
                                     make_term(0, -1)));

const rf1 = make_rational(p1, p2);
const rf2 = make_rational(p3, p4);

add(rf1, rf2);

            See if you get the correct answer, correctly reduced to lowest terms.

        The GCD computation is at the heart of any system that does operations
        on rational functions.  The algorithm used above, although
        mathematically straightforward, is extremely slow.  The slowness is
        due partly to the large number of division operations and partly to
        the enormous size of the intermediate coefficients generated by the
        pseudodivisions.  One of the active areas in the development of
        algebraic-manipulation systems is the design of better algorithms for
        computing polynomial GCDs.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-9' href='#footnote-9'>[9]</a>
