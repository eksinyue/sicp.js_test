    In the previous section, we saw how to design systems in which data
    objects can be represented in more than one way.  The key idea is to
    link the code that specifies the data operations to the several
    representations by means of generic interface
    functions.  Now we will
    see how to use this same idea not only to define operations that are
    generic over different representations but also to define operations
    that are generic over different kinds of arguments.  We have already
    seen several different packages of arithmetic operations: the primitive
    arithmetic (<kbd>+</kbd>, <kbd>-</kbd>, <kbd>*</kbd>, <kbd>/</kbd>) built into our
    language, the rational-number arithmetic (<kbd>add_rat</kbd>, <kbd>sub_rat</kbd>, <kbd>mul_rat</kbd>, <kbd>div_rat</kbd>) of
    section \ref{sec:rationals}, and the complex-number arithmetic that we
    implemented in section \ref{sec:data-directed}.  We will now use
    data-directed techniques to construct a package of arithmetic
    operations that incorporates all the arithmetic packages we have already
    constructed.

    Figure \ref{fig:generic-system} shows the structure of the system we
    shall build.  Notice the 
    
    abstraction barriers.  From the perspective
    of someone using <QUOTE>numbers,</QUOTE> there is a single
    function
    <kbd>add</kbd>
    that operates on whatever numbers are supplied.  The function <kbd>add</kbd> is part of
    a generic interface that allows the separate ordinary-arithmetic,
    rational-arithmetic, and complex-arithmetic packages to be accessed
    uniformly by programs that use numbers.  Any individual arithmetic
    package (such as the complex package) may itself be accessed through
    generic
    functions
    (such as <kbd>add_complex</kbd>) that combine packages
    designed for different representations (such as rectangular and
    polar).  Moreover, the structure of the system is additive, so
    that one can design the individual arithmetic packages separately and
    combine them to produce a generic arithmetic system.
