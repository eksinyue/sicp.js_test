      In section \ref{sec:black-box}, we noted
      that a
      function
      used as an element in creating a more complex
      function
      could be regarded not only as a collection of particular
      operations but also as a 
      functional
      abstraction.  That is, the details
      of how the
      function
      was implemented could be suppressed, and the
      particular
      function
      itself could be replaced by any other
      function
      with the same overall behavior.  In other words, we could make an
      abstraction that would separate the way the
      function
      would be used
      from the details of how the
      function
      would be implemented in terms of
      more primitive
      functions.  The analogous notion for compound data is
      called 
      
      <EM>data abstraction</EM>.  Data abstraction is a methodology that
      enables us to isolate how a compound data object is used from the
      details of how it is constructed from more primitive data objects.

      The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure the programs that
      are to use compound data objects so that they operate on 
      
      
      <QUOTE>abstract
        data.</QUOTE> That is, our programs should use data in such a way as to make
      no assumptions about the data that are not strictly necessary for
      performing the task at hand.  At the same time, a 
      
      
      <QUOTE>concrete</QUOTE> data
      representation is defined independent of the programs that use
      the data.  The interface between these two parts of our system will be
      a set of
      functions, called 
      
      <EM>selectors</EM> and 
      
      <EM>constructors</EM>,
      that implement the abstract data in terms of the concrete
      representation.  To illustrate this technique, we will consider how to
      design a set of
      functions
      for manipulating rational numbers.
