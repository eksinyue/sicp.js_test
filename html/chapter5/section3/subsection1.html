  A conventional computer memory can be thought of as an array of
  cubbyholes, each of which can contain a piece of information.  Each
  cubbyhole has a unique name, called its 
  
  <EM>address</EM> or 
  
  <EM>
    location</EM>.  Typical memory systems provide two primitive operations:
  one that fetches the data stored in a specified location and one that
  assigns new data to a specified location.  Memory addresses can be
  incremented to support sequential access to some set of the
  cubbyholes.  More generally, many important data operations require
  that memory addresses be treated as data, which can be stored in
  memory locations and manipulated in machine registers.  The
  representation of list structure is one application of such 
  
  
  <EM>
    address arithmetic</EM>.

  To model computer memory, we use a new kind of data
  structure called a 
  
  <EM>vector</EM> <kbd>(in JavaScript, a vector is essentially just a wrapper around an array)</kbd>.  Abstractly, a vector is a compound
  data object whose individual elements can be accessed by means of an
  integer index in an amount of time that is independent of the
  index.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a> In order to describe memory operations, we use two
  primitive 
  JavaScript functions
  for manipulating vectors:

  <UL>
    
    
    <LI><kbd>vector_ref(</kbd>$\textit{vector}, \textit{n}$<kbd>)</kbd> returns the $n$th
      element of the vector.

      
      
    </LI>
    <LI><kbd>vector_set(</kbd>, , <kbd>)</kbd> sets
      the $n$th element of the vector to the designated value.
    </LI>

  </UL>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
  For example, if <kbd>v</kbd> is a vector, then <kbd>vector_ref(v, 5)</kbd> gets
  the fifth entry in the vector <kbd>v</kbd> and <kbd>vector_set(v, 5, 7)</kbd>
  changes the value of the fifth entry of the vector <kbd>v</kbd> to 7.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a>
  For computer memory, this access can be implemented
  through the use of address arithmetic to combine a <EM>base address</EM>
  that specifies the beginning location of a vector in memory with an
  <EM>index</EM> that specifies the offset of a particular element of the vector.

  We can use vectors to implement the basic pair structures required for
  a list-structured memory.  Let us imagine that computer memory is
  divided into two vectors: 
  
  <kbd>the_heads</kbd> and 
  
  <kbd>the_tails</kbd>.  We will
  represent list structure as follows: A pointer to a pair is an index
  into the two vectors.  The 
  head of the pair is the entry in <kbd>the_heads</kbd> with the designated index, and the 
  tail of the pair is
  the entry in <kbd>the_tails</kbd> with the designated index.  We also need a
  representation for objects other than pairs (such as numbers and
  strings) and a way to distinguish one kind of data from another.
  There are many methods of accomplishing this, but they all reduce to
  using 
  
  
  <EM>typed pointers</EM>, that is, to extending the notion of
  <QUOTE>pointer</QUOTE> to include information on data type.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a> The data type enables the system to
  distinguish a pointer to a pair (which consists of the <QUOTE>pair</QUOTE> data
  type and an index into the memory vectors) from pointers to other
  kinds of data (which consist of some other data type and whatever is
  being used to represent data of that type).  Two data objects are
  
  considered to be the same (<kbd>===</kbd>) if their pointers are
  identical.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a> 
  Figure \ref{fig:box-and-pointer-memory}
  illustrates the use of this method to represent the list <kbd>list(list(1, 2), 3, 4)</kbd>, whose box-and-pointer diagram is also shown.  We use letter
  prefixes to denote the data-type information.  Thus, a pointer to the
  pair with index 5 is denoted <kbd>p5</kbd>, the empty list is denoted by
  the pointer <kbd>e0</kbd>, and a pointer to the number 4 is denoted <kbd>n4</kbd>.  In the box-and-pointer diagram, we have indicated at the lower
  left of each pair the vector index that specifies where the <kbd>head</kbd>
  and <kbd>tail</kbd> of the pair are stored.  The blank locations in <kbd>the_heads</kbd> and <kbd>the_tails</kbd> may contain parts of other list
  structures (not of interest here).

  A pointer to a number, such as <kbd>n4</kbd>,
  might consist of a type indicating numeric data together with the
  actual representation of the number 4.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-5' href='#footnote-5'>[5]</a>
  To deal with numbers that are too large to
  be represented in the fixed amount of space allocated for a single
  pointer, we could use a distinct 
  
  <EM>bignum</EM> data type, for which the
  pointer designates a list in which the parts of the number are

  A string
  might be represented as a typed pointer that designates a
  sequence of the characters that form the
  string's
  printed representation.
  This sequence is constructed by the JavaScript reader when the character string
  is initially encountered in input.  Since we want two instances of a
  string
  to be recognized as the <QUOTE>same</QUOTE>
  string
  by <kbd>===</kbd> and we
  
  want <kbd>===</kbd> to be a simple test for equality of pointers, we must
  ensure that if the reader sees the same character string twice, it
  will use the same pointer (to the same sequence of characters) to
  represent both occurrences.  To accomplish this, the reader maintains
  a table, traditionally called the 
  
  <EM>obarray</EM>, of all the symbols it
  has ever encountered.  When the reader encounters a character string
  and is about to construct a symbol, it checks the obarray to see if it
  has ever before seen the same character string.  If it has not, it
  uses the characters to construct a new symbol (a typed pointer to a
  new character sequence) and enters this pointer in the obarray.  If the
  reader has seen the string before, it returns the symbol pointer
  stored in the obarray.  This process of replacing character strings by
  unique pointers is called 
  
  
  <EM>interning</EM> symbols.

  Implementing the primitive list operations

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  
  Given the above representation scheme, we can replace each
  <QUOTE>primitive</QUOTE> list operation of a register machine with one or more
  primitive vector operations.  We will use two registers, <kbd>the_heads</kbd> and
  <kbd>the_tails</kbd>, to identify the memory vectors, and will
  assume that <kbd>vector_ref</kbd> and <kbd>vector_set</kbd> are available as
  primitive operations.  We also assume that numeric operations on
  pointers (such as incrementing a pointer, using a pair pointer to
  index a vector, or adding two numbers) use only the index portion of
  the typed pointer.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
  For example, we can make a register machine support the instructions

  
  
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
assign(reg$_{1}$,list(op("head"), reg$_{2}$))
assign(reg$_{1}$,list(op("tail"), reg$_{2}$))
    
  </kbd>

  if we implement these, respectively, as

  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
assign(reg$_{1}$,list(op("vector_ref"), reg("the_heads"), reg$_{2}$))
assign(reg$_{1}$,list(op("vector_ref"), reg("the_tails"), reg$_{2}$))
    
  </kbd>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
  The instructions
  
  
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
perform(list(op("set_head"), reg($\textit{reg}_{1}$), reg($\textit{reg}_{2}$)))
perform(list(op("set_tail"), reg($\textit{reg}_{1}$), reg($\textit{reg}_{2}$)))
    
  </kbd>
  are implemented as
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
perform(op("vector_set"), list(reg("the_heads"), reg($\textit{reg}_{1}$), reg($\textit{reg}_{2}$)))
perform(op("vector_set"), list((reg("the_tails"), reg($\textit{reg}_{1}$), reg($\textit{reg}_{2}$)))
    
  </kbd>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  The operation <kbd>pair</kbd> is performed by allocating an unused index and storing the
  arguments to <kbd>pair</kbd> in <kbd>the_heads</kbd> and <kbd>the_tails</kbd> at that
  indexed vector position.  We presume that there is a special register,
  
  <kbd>free</kbd>, that always holds a pair pointer containing the next
  available index, and that we can increment the index part of that
  pointer to find the next free location.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-7' href='#footnote-7'>[7]</a>
  For example, the instruction

  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
assign($\textit{reg}_{1}$, list(op("pair"), reg($\textit{reg}_{2}$), reg($\textit{reg}_{3}$))
    
  </kbd>
  is implemented as the following sequence of vector
  operations:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-8' href='#footnote-8'>[8]</a>

  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
perform(op("vector_set"), list(reg("the_heads"), reg("free"), reg($\textit{reg}_{2}$))),
perform(op("vector_set"), list(reg("the_tails"), reg("free"), reg($\textit{reg}_{3}$))),
assign($\textit{reg}_{1}$, reg("free")),
assign("free", list(op("+"), reg("free"), cons(1)))

  The <kbd>===</kbd> operation

  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
list(op("==="), reg($\textit{reg}_{1}$), reg($\textit{reg}_{2}$))
    
  </kbd>
  simply tests the equality of all fields in the registers, and
  
  
  
  
  predicates such as <kbd>is_pair</kbd>, <kbd>is_null</kbd>, <kbd>is_string</kbd>, and <kbd>is_number</kbd> need only check the type field.

  Implementing stacks
      </h2></div>

      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Although our register machines use stacks, we need do nothing special
  here, since stacks can be modeled in terms of lists.  The stack can be
  a list of the saved values, pointed to by a special register <kbd>the_stack</kbd>.  Thus, <kbd>save(</kbd>$\textit{reg}$<kbd>)</kbd> can be implemented as

  
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
assign("the_stack", list(op("pair"), reg($\textit{reg}$), reg("the-stack")))
    
  </kbd>
  
  Similarly, <kbd>restore(</kbd>$\textit{reg}$<kbd>)</kbd> can be implemented as
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
assign($\textit{reg}$, list(op("head"), reg("the_stack")))
assign("the_stack", list(op("tail"), reg("the_stack")))
    
  </kbd>

  and <kbd>perform(op("initialize_stack"))</kbd> can be implemented as
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
assign("the_stack", cons(null))
    
  </kbd>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
  These operations can be further expanded in terms of the vector
  operations given above.  In conventional computer architectures,
  however, it is usually advantageous to allocate the stack as a
  separate vector.  Then pushing and popping the stack can be
  accomplished by incrementing or decrementing an index into that
  vector.
