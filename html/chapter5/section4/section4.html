      In section \ref{sec:designing-register-machines} we saw how to
      transform simple Source programs into descriptions of register
      machines.  We will now perform this transformation on a more complex
      program, the metacircular evaluator of
      sections \ref{sec:core-of-evaluator}â€“\ref{sec:running-eval},
      which shows how
      the behavior of a Source interpreter can be described in terms of the
      functions
      <kbd>eval</kbd> and <kbd>apply</kbd>.
      The <EM>explicit-control
  evaluator</EM> that we develop in this section shows how the underlying
      function-calling and argument-passing mechanisms used in the
      evaluation process can be described in terms of operations on
      registers and stacks.  In addition, the explicit-control evaluator can
      serve as an implementation of a Source interpreter, written in a
      language that is very similar to the native machine language of
      conventional computers.  The evaluator can be executed by the
      register-machine simulator of section \ref{sec:simulator}.
      Alternatively, it can be used as a starting point for building a
      machine-language implementation of a Source evaluator, or even a
      
      
      
      special-purpose machine for evaluating Source expressions.
      Figure \ref{fig:Scheme-chip} shows such a hardware implementation: a
      silicon chip that acts as an evaluator for Scheme, the language for which this book was originally written..  The chip designers
      started with the data-path and controller specifications for a
      register machine similar to the evaluator described in this section
      and used design automation programs to construct the
      integrated-circuit layout.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>

      In designing the explicit-control evaluator, we must specify the
      operations to be used in our register machine.  We described the
      metacircular evaluator in terms of abstract syntax, using
      functions
      such as <kbd>quoted?</kbd> and <kbd>make-procedure</kbd>.  In implementing the
      register machine, we could expand these
      functions
      into sequences of
      elementary list-structure memory operations, and implement these
      operations on our register machine.  However, this would make our
      evaluator very long, obscuring the basic structure with
      details.  To clarify the presentation, we will include as primitive
      operations of the register machine the syntax
      functions
      given in
      section \ref{sec:representing-expressions} and the
      functions
      for
      representing environments and other run-time data given in
      sections \ref{sec:eval-data-structures} and \ref{sec:running-eval}.
      In order to completely specify an evaluator that could be programmed
      in a low-level machine language or implemented in hardware, we would
      replace these operations by more elementary operations, using the
      list-structure implementation we described in
      section \ref{sec:storage-allocation}.

      Our Source evaluator register machine includes a stack and seven
      registers: <kbd>exp</kbd>, <kbd>env</kbd>, <kbd>val</kbd>, <kbd>continue</kbd>, <kbd>proc</kbd>,
      <kbd>argl</kbd>, and <kbd>unev</kbd>.  <kbd>Exp</kbd> is used to hold the expression
      to be evaluated, and <kbd>env</kbd> contains the environment in which the
      evaluation is to be performed.  At the end of an evaluation, <kbd>val</kbd>
      contains the value obtained by evaluating the expression in the
      designated environment.  The <kbd>continue</kbd> register is used to
      implement recursion, as explained in
      section \ref{sec:stack-recursion}.  (The evaluator needs to call
      itself recursively, since evaluating an expression requires evaluating
      its subexpressions.)  The registers <kbd>proc</kbd>, <kbd>argl</kbd>, and <kbd>unev</kbd> are used in evaluating combinations.

      We will not provide a data-path diagram to show how the registers and
      operations of the evaluator are connected, nor will we give the
      complete list of machine operations.  These are implicit in the
      evaluator's controller, which will be presented in detail.
