  With the implementation of the explicit-control evaluator we come to
  the end of a development, begun in chapter~1, in which we have
  explored successively more precise models of the evaluation process.
  We started with the relatively informal substitution model, then
  extended this in chapter~3 to the environment model, which enabled us
  to deal with state and change.  In the metacircular evaluator of
  chapter~4, we used Scheme itself as a language for making more explicit
  the environment structure constructed during evaluation of an
  expression.  Now, with register machines, we have taken a close look
  at the evaluator's mechanisms for storage management,
  argument passing, and control.  At
  each new level of description, we have had to raise issues and resolve
  ambiguities that were not apparent at the previous, less precise
  treatment of evaluation.  To understand the behavior of the
  explicit-control evaluator, we can simulate it and monitor its
  performance.

  We will install a driver loop in our evaluator machine.  This plays
  the role of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$driver_loop$}
  function
  of
  section~\ref{sec:running-eval}.  The evaluator will repeatedly print a
  prompt, read an expression, evaluate the expression by going to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$eval_dispatch$}, and print the result.  The following instructions form
  the beginning of the explicit-control evaluator's controller
  sequence:<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>

  If we combine all the code fragments presented in sections
  \ref{sec:eceval-core}–\ref{sec:running-evaluator}, we can create an
  evaluator machine model that we can run using the register-machine simulator
  of section~\ref{sec:simulator}.

  
\begin{JavaScript}
function eceval() {
    return make_machine(list("exp", "env", "val", "proc", "argl", "continue", "unev"),
                        eceval_operations,
                        list(read_eval_print_loop,
                             ... /* entire machine controller as given above */ 
                             ));
}
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
  We must define Scheme
  functions
  to simulate the
  operations used as primitives by the evaluator.  These are
  the same
  functions
  we used for the metacircular evaluator in
  section~\ref{sec:mc-eval}, together with the few additional ones
  defined in footnotes throughout section~\ref{sec:eceval}.
  
\begin{JavaScript}
const eceval_operations = 
    list(list("is_self_evaluating", is_self_evaluating),
         ... /* complete list of operations for eceval machine */
         );
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Finally, we can initialize the global environment and run the evaluator:
  
\begin{JavaScript}
const the_global_environment = setup_environment();

start(eceval);
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Of course, evaluating expressions in this way will take much longer
  than if we had directly typed them into Scheme, because of the
  multiple levels of simulation involved.  Our expressions are evaluated
  by the explicit-control-evaluator machine, which is being simulated by
  a Scheme program, which is itself being evaluated by the Scheme
  interpreter.
  
      </p></div>

      \subsubsection{ 
  Monitoring the performance of the evaluator
      

      
      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p9' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  Simulation can be a powerful tool to guide the implementation of
  evaluators.  Simulations make it easy not only to explore variations
  of the register-machine design but also to monitor the performance of
  the simulated evaluator.  For example, one important factor in
  performance is how efficiently the evaluator uses the stack.  We can
  observe the number of stack operations required to evaluate various
  expressions by defining the evaluator register machine with the
  version of the simulator that collects statistics on stack use
  (section~\ref{sec:monitor}), and adding an instruction at the
  evaluator's {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$print_result$} entry point to print the
  statistics:

  
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
"print_result",
          perform(op("print_stack_statistics")), // added instruction
          perform(op("announce_output"), const("/// EC-Eval value:")),
          /* ... same as before ... */
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=4&prgrm=EQBwTglgdgLg+mApgZwK4BsbADQCgAEhRxIiYAZgPZgC2AFJSHaJLHMjAIYDGA1u1xgQOEbsmABKCdnwB6Wfk4ATJYiX5oHMKm5DKUAsSOkK1eo2acoUSqijdEcWzBCos0-N30dm8hQFEAYQBafwA3TnR8CPRURAAuSWlDIyJZACp8ADoc-GROGkRFZHwAI0QqJGzc9NkgA}{\usebox\lstbox}


      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p10' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Interactions with the evaluator now look like this:
  
\begin{JavaScript}
/// EC-Eval input:
function factorial (n) {
return n === 1 ?
1
n * factorial(n - 1); }
(total-pushes = 3 maximum-depth = 3)
/// EC-Eval value:
ok

/// EC-Eval input:
factorial(5);
(total-pushes = 144 maximum-depth = 28)
/// EC-Eval value:
120
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Note that the driver loop of the evaluator reinitializes the stack
  at the start of
  each interaction, so that the statistics printed will refer only to
  stack operations used to evaluate the previous expression.
      </p></div>

      
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  
  Use the monitored stack to explore the tail-recursive property of the
  evaluator (section~\ref{sec:sequence-evaluation}).  Start the
  evaluator and define the iterative {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$factorial$}
  function
  from
  section~\ref{sec:recursion-and-iteration}:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
function factorial(n) {
    function iter(product, counter, max_count) {
        return counter > max_count
               ? product
               : fact_iter(counter * product,
                           counter + 1,
                           max_count);
    }

    return iter(1, 1, n);
}
\end{JavaScript}


  Run the
  function
  with some small values of $n$.  Record the maximum
  stack depth and the number of pushes required to compute $n!$ for each of
  these values.
  
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item{
      You will find that the maximum depth required to evaluate $n!$ is
      independent of $n$.  What is that depth?
    }
\item{
      Determine from your data a formula in terms of $n$ for the total
      number of push operations used in evaluating $n!$ for any $n \geq 1$.
      Note that the number of operations used is a linear function of $n$
      and is thus determined by two constants.
    }
\end{enumerate}

      
\end{Exercise}


      
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

  
  For comparison with exercise~\ref{ex:tail-rec-fact}, explore the
  behavior of the following
  function
  for computing factorials
  recursively:
  
\begin{JavaScript}
function factorial(n) {
    return n === 1 
           ? 1
           : n * factorial(n - 1);
}
\end{JavaScript}

  By running this
  function
  with the monitored stack, determine, as a
  function of $n$, the maximum depth of the stack and the total number
  of pushes used in evaluating $n!$ for $n \geq 1$.  (Again, these functions
  will be linear.)  Summarize your experiments by filling in the
  following table with the appropriate expressions in terms of $n$:
  
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\maxsizebox{\linewidth}{0.8\paperheight}{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{{img\string_original/527table}.svg}}
\end{figure}


  The maximum depth is a measure of the amount of space used by the
  evaluator in carrying out the computation, and the number of pushes
  correlates well with the time required.
  
      
\end{Exercise}


      
      
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  
  Modify the definition of the evaluator by changing
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$eval_sequence$} as described in
  section~\ref{sec:sequence-evaluation} so that the evaluator is no
  longer tail-recursive.  Rerun your experiments from
  exercises~\ref{ex:tail-rec-fact} and~\ref{ex:rec-fact} to demonstrate
  that both versions of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$factorial$}
  function
  now require space
  that grows linearly with their input.
      
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Exercise}

  
  Monitor the stack operations in the tree-recursive Fibonacci computation:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
function fib(n) {
    return n < 2 ? n : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
\end{JavaScript}

  
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item{
      Give a formula in terms of $n$ for the maximum depth of the stack
      required to compute ${\textrm{Fib}}(n)$ for $n \geq 2$.  Hint: In
      section~\ref{sec:tree-recursion} we argued that the space used by this
      process grows linearly with $n$.
    }
\item{
      Give a formula for the total number of pushes used to compute
      ${\textrm{Fib}}(n)$ for $n \geq 2$.  You should find that the number of
      pushes (which correlates well with the time used) grows exponentially
      with $n$.  Hint: Let $S(n)$ be the number of pushes used in computing
      ${\textrm{Fib}}(n)$.  You should be able to argue that there is a formula
      that expresses $S(n)$ in terms of $S(n-1)$, $S(n-2)$, and some fixed
      <QUOTE>overhead</QUOTE> constant $k$ that is independent of $n$.  Give the
      formula, and say what $k$ is.  Then show that $S(n)$ can be expressed
      as $a {\textrm{Fib}}(n+1) + b$ and give the values of $a$ and $b$.
    }
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  
  Our evaluator currently catches and signals only two kinds of
  errors—unknown expression types and unknown
  function
  types.  Other
  errors will take us out of the evaluator read-eval-print loop.  When
  we run the evaluator using the register-machine simulator, these
  errors are caught by the underlying Scheme system.  This is analogous
  to the computer crashing when a user program makes an
  error.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-4' href='#footnote-4'>[4]</a>
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item{
      Errors that occur in the evaluation process, such as an attempt to
      access an unbound variable, could be caught by changing the lookup
      operation to make it return a distinguished condition code, which cannot
      be a possible value of any user variable.  The evaluator can test
      for this condition code and then do what is necessary to go to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$signal-error$}.  Find all of the places in the evaluator where such a
      change is necessary and fix them.  This is lots of work.
    }
\item{
      Much worse is the problem of handling errors that are signaled by
      applying primitive
      functions, such as an attempt to divide by zero or
      an attempt to extract the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$head$} of a symbol.  In a professionally
      written high-quality system, each primitive application is checked for
      safety as part of the primitive.  For example, every call to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$head$}
      could first check that the argument is a pair.  If the argument is not
      a pair, the application would return a distinguished condition code to
      the evaluator, which would then report the failure.  We could arrange
      for this in our register-machine simulator by making each primitive
      function
      check for applicability and returning an appropriate distinguished
      condition code on failure. Then the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$primitive-apply$} code in the
      evaluator can check for the condition code and go to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$signal-error$} if necessary.  Build this structure and make it work.
      This is a major project.
    }
\end{enumerate}

        It is a large project to make a real
  error system work, but it is well worth the effort to understand what
  is involved here.
