  One of the most common optimizations performed by compilers is the
  optimization of variable lookup.  Our compiler, as we have implemented
  it so far, generates code that uses the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lookup_variable_value$}
  operation of the evaluator machine.  This searches for a variable by
  comparing it with each variable that is currently bound, working frame
  by frame outward through the run-time environment.  This search can be
  expensive if the frames are deeply nested or if there are many
  variables.  For example, consider the problem of looking up the value
  of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} while evaluating the expression {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x * y * z$} in an
  application of the
  function
  that is returned by

  
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
let x = 3;
let y = 4;
(a, b, c, d, e) => {
    let y = a * b * x;
    let z = c + d + x;
    return x * y * z;
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

  Since a {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$let$} expression is just syntactic sugar for a {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$function declaration expression$} combination, this expression is equivalent to

  
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
((x, y) =>
    ((a, b, c, d, e) =>
        ((y, z) => x * y * z)(a * b * x, c + d + x)))(3, 4)
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

  Each time {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lookup_variable_value$} searches for {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$}, it must
  determine that the symbol {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} is not {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$eq?$} to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} or {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$z$} (in the first frame), nor to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$c$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$d$}, or
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$e$} (in the second frame).  We will assume, for the moment, that
  our programs do not use {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$define$}—that variables are
  bound only with {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lambda$}.  Because our language is 
  
  lexically
  scoped, the run-time environment for any expression will have a
  structure that parallels the lexical structure of the program in which
  the expression appears.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>function
  is applied the variable
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} in {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x * y * z$} will be found two frames out from the
  current frame and will be the first variable in that frame.
      
  Thus, the compiler can know, when it analyzes the
  above expression, that each time the
  function
  is applied the variable
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} in {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x * y * z$} will be found two frames out from the
  current frame and will be the first variable in that frame.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  We can exploit this fact by inventing a new kind of variable-lookup
  operation, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lexical_address_lookup$}, that takes as arguments an
  environment and a <EM>lexical address</EM> that consists of two numbers:
  a <EM>frame number</EM>, which specifies how many frames to pass over,
  and a <EM>displacement number</EM>, which specifies how many variables to
  pass over in that frame.  
  
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$Lexical_address_lookup$} will produce
  the value of the variable stored at that lexical address relative to
  the current environment.  If we add the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lexical_address_lookup$}
  operation to our machine, we can make the compiler generate code that
  references variables using this operation, rather than {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lookup_variable_value$}.  Similarly, our compiled code can use a new
  
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lexical_address_set$}  operation instead of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$set_variable_value$}.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
  In order to generate such code, the compiler must be able to determine
  the lexical address of a variable it is about to compile a reference
  to.  The lexical address of a variable in a program depends on where
  one is in the code.  For example, in the following program, the
  address of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} in expression e1 is (2,0)—two frames back
  and the first variable in the frame.  At that point {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} is at
  address (0,0) and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$c$} is at address (1,2).  In expression
  e2,$\,$ {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} is at (1,0), $\,$ {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$} is at (1,1), and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$c$} is at (0,2).

  
\begin{JavaScript}
((x, y) =>
    ((a, b, c, d, e) =>
        ((y, z) => $e_1$)($e_2$, c + d + x)))(3, 4)
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>

  One way for the compiler to produce code that uses lexical addressing
  is to maintain a data structure called a <EM>compile-time
    environment</EM>.  This keeps track of which variables will be at which
  positions in which frames in the run-time environment when a
  particular variable-access operation is executed.  The compile-time
  environment is a list of frames, each containing a list of variables.
  (There will of course be no values bound to the variables, since
  values are not computed at compile time.)  The compile-time
  environment becomes an additional argument to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$compile$} and is
  passed along to each code generator.  The top-level call to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$compile$} uses an empty compile-time environment.
  When a {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lambda$} body is compiled, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$compile_lambda_body$}
  extends the compile-time environment by a frame containing the
  function's parameters, so that the sequence making up the body
  is compiled with that extended environment.
  At each point in the compilation, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$compile_variable$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$compile_assignment$} use the compile-time
  environment in order to generate the appropriate lexical addresses.

  Write a

\begin{Exercise}

  Using {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$find_variable$} from exercise~\ref{ex:find-variable},
  rewrite {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$compile_variable$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$compile_assignment$} to output
  lexical-address instructions.  In cases where {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$find-variable$}
  returns {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$not_found$} (that is, where the variable is not in the
  compile-time environment), you should have the code generators use the
  evaluator operations, as before, to search for the binding.
  (The only place a variable that is not found at compile time can be is in
  the global environment, which is part of the run-time environment but
  is not part of the compile-time 
  environment.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>{\lstinline[mathescape=true]$op("get_global_environment")$}, instead of having them search the whole run-time
  environment found in {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$env$}.)
  Test the modified compiler on a few simple cases, such as the nested
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lambda$} combination at the beginning of this section.
  
      
  Thus, if you wish, you may have the evaluator operations look directly in
  the global environment, which can be obtained with the operation {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$op("get_global_environment")$}, instead of having them search the whole run-time
  environment found in {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$env$}.)

\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  We argued in section~\ref{sec:internal-definitions} that internal definitions
  for block structure should not be considered <QUOTE>real</QUOTE> {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$define$}s.  Rather,
  a
  function
  body should be interpreted as if the internal variables being
  defined were installed as ordinary {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$lambda$} variables initialized to their
  correct values using assignment.  Section~\ref{sec:internal-definitions} and
  exercise~\ref{ex:internal-defs} showed how to modify the metacircular
  interpreter to accomplish this by scanning out internal definitions.  Modify
  the compiler to perform the same transformation before it compiles a
  function
  body.

\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  
  
  In this section we have focused on the use of the compile-time
  environment to produce lexical addresses.  But there are other uses
  for compile-time environments.  For instance, in
  exercise~\ref{ex:open-code} we increased the efficiency of compiled
  code by open-coding primitive
  functions.  Our implementation treated
  the names of open-coded
  functions
  as reserved words.  If a program
  were to rebind such a name, the mechanism described in
  exercise~\ref{ex:open-code} would still open-code it as a primitive,
  ignoring the new binding.  For example, consider the
  function

  
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
(+ * a b x y) => (a * x) + (b * y)
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

\href{https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/playground#chap=4&prgrm=BQagBAVGCGYEZgB5gJ4EowF4B8ZiykQ3GASnSA}{\usebox\lstbox}


  which computes a linear combination of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$x$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$y$}.  We might
  call it with arguments {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$+matrix$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$*matrix$}, and four
  matrices, but the open-coding compiler would still open-code the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$+$} and the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$*$} in {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$(a * x) + (b * y)$} as primitive {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$+$}
  and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$*$}.  Modify the open-coding compiler to consult the
  compile-time environment in order to compile the correct code for
  expressions involving the names of primitive
  functions.
  (The code will work correctly as long as the program does not {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$define$} or assignment these names.)
