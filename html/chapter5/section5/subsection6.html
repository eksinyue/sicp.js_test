  One of the most common optimizations performed by compilers is the
  optimization of variable lookup.  Our compiler, as we have implemented
  it so far, generates code that uses the <kbd>lookup_variable_value</kbd>
  operation of the evaluator machine.  This searches for a variable by
  comparing it with each variable that is currently bound, working frame
  by frame outward through the run-time environment.  This search can be
  expensive if the frames are deeply nested or if there are many
  variables.  For example, consider the problem of looking up the value
  of <kbd>x</kbd> while evaluating the expression <kbd>x * y * z</kbd> in an
  application of the
  function
  that is returned by

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_119_1_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint' title='Evaluate Javascript expression'

  Since a <kbd>let</kbd> expression is just syntactic sugar for a <kbd>function declaration expression</kbd> combination, this expression is equivalent to

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_119_2_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint' title='Evaluate Javascript expression'
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
((x, y) =>
    ((a, b, c, d, e) =>
        ((y, z) => x * y * z)(a * b * x, c + d + x)))(3, 4)
\end{JavaScriptClickable}

</pre>

</div></div>
  Each time <kbd>lookup_variable_value</kbd> searches for <kbd>x</kbd>, it must
  determine that the symbol <kbd>x</kbd> is not <kbd>eq?</kbd> to <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>z</kbd> (in the first frame), nor to <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>, or
  <kbd>e</kbd> (in the second frame).  We will assume, for the moment, that
  our programs do not use <kbd>define</kbd>—that variables are
  bound only with <kbd>lambda</kbd>.  Because our language is 
  
  lexically
  scoped, the run-time environment for any expression will have a
  structure that parallels the lexical structure of the program in which
  the expression appears.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
  Thus, the compiler can know, when it analyzes the
  above expression, that each time the
  function
  is applied the variable
  <kbd>x</kbd> in <kbd>x * y * z</kbd> will be found two frames out from the
  current frame and will be the first variable in that frame.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  We can exploit this fact by inventing a new kind of variable-lookup
  operation, <kbd>lexical_address_lookup</kbd>, that takes as arguments an
  environment and a <EM>lexical address</EM> that consists of two numbers:
  a <EM>frame number</EM>, which specifies how many frames to pass over,
  and a <EM>displacement number</EM>, which specifies how many variables to
  pass over in that frame.  
  
  <kbd>Lexical_address_lookup</kbd> will produce
  the value of the variable stored at that lexical address relative to
  the current environment.  If we add the <kbd>lexical_address_lookup</kbd>
  operation to our machine, we can make the compiler generate code that
  references variables using this operation, rather than <kbd>lookup_variable_value</kbd>.  Similarly, our compiled code can use a new
  
  <kbd>lexical_address_set</kbd>  operation instead of <kbd>set_variable_value</kbd>.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
  In order to generate such code, the compiler must be able to determine
  the lexical address of a variable it is about to compile a reference
  to.  The lexical address of a variable in a program depends on where
  one is in the code.  For example, in the following program, the
  address of <kbd>x</kbd> in expression e1 is (2,0)—two frames back
  and the first variable in the frame.  At that point <kbd>y</kbd> is at
  address (0,0) and <kbd>c</kbd> is at address (1,2).  In expression
  e2,$\,$ <kbd>x</kbd> is at (1,0), $\,$ <kbd>y</kbd> is at (1,1), and <kbd>c</kbd> is at (0,2).

  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
((x, y) =>
    ((a, b, c, d, e) =>
        ((y, z) => $e_1$)($e_2$, c + d + x)))(3, 4)
    
  </kbd>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>

  One way for the compiler to produce code that uses lexical addressing
  is to maintain a data structure called a <EM>compile-time
    environment</EM>.  This keeps track of which variables will be at which
  positions in which frames in the run-time environment when a
  particular variable-access operation is executed.  The compile-time
  environment is a list of frames, each containing a list of variables.
  (There will of course be no values bound to the variables, since
  values are not computed at compile time.)  The compile-time
  environment becomes an additional argument to <kbd>compile</kbd> and is
  passed along to each code generator.  The top-level call to <kbd>compile</kbd> uses an empty compile-time environment.
  When a <kbd>lambda</kbd> body is compiled, <kbd>compile_lambda_body</kbd>
  extends the compile-time environment by a frame containing the
  function's parameters, so that the sequence making up the body
  is compiled with that extended environment.
  At each point in the compilation, <kbd>compile_variable</kbd> and <kbd>compile_assignment</kbd> use the compile-time
  environment in order to generate the appropriate lexical addresses.

  Exercises \ref{ex:lexical-address-start}

  the lexical-addressing strategy in order to incorporate lexical lookup

\begin{Exercise}

  
  Write a
  function
  <kbd>lexical_address_lookup</kbd> that implements the new
  lookup operation.  It should take two arguments—a lexical address
  and a run-time environment—and return the value of the variable
  stored at the specified lexical address.  <kbd>Lexical_address_lookup</kbd>
  should signal an error if the value of the variable is the symbol <kbd>*unassigned*</kbd>.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-2' href='#footnote-2'>[2]</a> Also write a
  function
  <kbd>lexical_address_set</kbd> that
  implements the operation that changes the value of the variable at a
  specified lexical address.

  Write a

  <kbd>find_variable</kbd> that takes as arguments a
  variable and a compile-time environment and returns the lexical

  example, in the program fragment that is shown above, the compile-time
  environment during the compilation of expression $e_1$ is <kbd>list(list("y", "z"), list("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"), list("x", "y"))</kbd>.  <kbd>Find_variable</kbd> should produce

\begin{Exercise}

  Using <kbd>find_variable</kbd> from exercise \ref{ex:find-variable},
  rewrite <kbd>compile_variable</kbd> and <kbd>compile_assignment</kbd> to output
  lexical-address instructions.  In cases where <kbd>find-variable</kbd>
  returns <kbd>not_found</kbd> (that is, where the variable is not in the
  compile-time environment), you should have the code generators use the
  evaluator operations, as before, to search for the binding.
  (The only place a variable that is not found at compile time can be is in
  the global environment, which is part of the run-time environment but
  is not part of the compile-time 
  environment.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-3' href='#footnote-3'>[3]</a>
  Thus, if you wish, you may have the evaluator operations look directly in
  the global environment, which can be obtained with the operation <kbd>op("get_global_environment")</kbd>, instead of having them search the whole run-time
  environment found in <kbd>env</kbd>.)
  Test the modified compiler on a few simple cases, such as the nested
  <kbd>lambda</kbd> combination at the beginning of this section.

\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  We argued in section \ref{sec:internal-definitions} that internal definitions
  for block structure should not be considered <QUOTE>real</QUOTE> <kbd>define</kbd>s.  Rather,
  a
  function
  body should be interpreted as if the internal variables being
  defined were installed as ordinary <kbd>lambda</kbd> variables initialized to their
  correct values using assignment.  Section \ref{sec:internal-definitions} and
  exercise \ref{ex:internal-defs} showed how to modify the metacircular
  interpreter to accomplish this by scanning out internal definitions.  Modify
  the compiler to perform the same transformation before it compiles a
  function
  body.
  
  
      
\end{Exercise}


      
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  
  
  In this section we have focused on the use of the compile-time
  environment to produce lexical addresses.  But there are other uses
  for compile-time environments.  For instance, in
  exercise \ref{ex:open-code} we increased the efficiency of compiled
  code by open-coding primitive
  functions.  Our implementation treated
  the names of open-coded
  functions
  as reserved words.  If a program
  were to rebind such a name, the mechanism described in
  exercise \ref{ex:open-code} would still open-code it as a primitive,
  ignoring the new binding.  For example, consider the
  function

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_119_6_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint' title='Evaluate Javascript expression'
\begin{lrbox}{\lstbox}
\begin{JavaScriptClickable}
(+ * a b x y) => (a * x) + (b * y)
\end{JavaScriptClickable}
\end{lrbox}

</div></div>
  which computes a linear combination of <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>y</kbd>.  We might
  call it with arguments <kbd>+matrix</kbd>, <kbd>*matrix</kbd>, and four
  matrices, but the open-coding compiler would still open-code the <kbd>+</kbd> and the <kbd>*</kbd> in <kbd>(a * x) + (b * y)</kbd> as primitive <kbd>+</kbd>
  and <kbd>*</kbd>.  Modify the open-coding compiler to consult the
  compile-time environment in order to compile the correct code for
  expressions involving the names of primitive
  functions.
  (The code will work correctly as long as the program does not <kbd>define</kbd> or assignment these names.)
