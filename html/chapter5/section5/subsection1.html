  In section \ref{sec:separating-analysis} we modified our original
  metacircular interpreter to separate analysis from execution.  We
  analyzed each expression to produce an execution
  function
  that took
  an environment as argument and performed the required operations.  In
  our compiler, we will do essentially the same analysis.  Instead of
  producing execution
  functions, however, we will generate sequences of
  instructions to be run by our register machine.

  The
  function
  <kbd>compile</kbd> is the top-level dispatch in the compiler.
  It corresponds to the <kbd>eval</kbd>
  function
  of
  section \ref{sec:core-of-evaluator}, the <kbd>analyze</kbd>
  function
  of
  section \ref{sec:separating-analysis}, and the <kbd>eval_dispatch</kbd>
  entry point of the explicit-control-evaluator in
  section \ref{sec:eceval-core}.
  The compiler, like the interpreters, uses the 
  
  expression-syntax
  functions
  defined in section \ref{sec:representing-expressions}.<a class='superscript' id='footnote-link-1' href='#footnote-1'>[1]</a>
  <kbd>Compile</kbd> performs a case
  analysis on the syntactic type of the expression to be compiled.  For
  each type of expression, it dispatches to a specialized 
  
  <EM>code
    generator</EM>:

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_114_1_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function compile(exp, target, linkage) {
    return is_self-evaluating(exp)

  <kbd>Compile</kbd> and the code generators that it calls take two arguments
  in addition to the expression to compile.  There is a 
  
  <EM>target</EM>,
  which specifies the register in which the compiled code is to return
  the value of the expression.  There is also a 
  
  <EM>linkage
    descriptor</EM>, which describes how the code resulting from the
  compilation of the expression should proceed when it has finished its
  execution.  The linkage descriptor can require that the code do one of
  the following three things:

  <UL>
    <LI>continue at the next instruction in sequence (this is
      
      specified by the linkage descriptor <kbd>next</kbd>),

    </LI>
    <LI>return from the
      function
      being compiled (this is specified
      
      by the linkage descriptor <kbd>return</kbd>), or

    </LI>
    <LI>jump to a named entry point (this is specified by using the
      designated label as the linkage descriptor).
    </LI>

  </UL>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>

  For example, compiling the expression <kbd>5</kbd> (which is
  self-evaluating) with a target of the <kbd>val</kbd> register and a
  linkage of <kbd>next</kbd> should produce the instruction

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_114_2_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
assign("val", constant(5));
</pre></div></div>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p5' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Compiling the same expression with a linkage of <kbd>return</kbd> should
  produce the instructions

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_114_3_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
assign("val", constant(5));
      go_to(reg("continue"));
</pre></div></div>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
  In the first case, execution will continue with the next instruction
  in the sequence. In the second case, we will return from a
  function
  call.  In both cases, the value of the expression will be placed into
  the target <kbd>val</kbd> register.

  Each code generator returns an 
  <EM>instruction sequence</EM> containing
  the object code it has generated for the expression.  Code generation
  for a compound expression is accomplished by combining the output from
  simpler code generators for component expressions, just as
  evaluation of a compound expression is accomplished by evaluating the
  component expressions.

  The simplest method for combining instruction sequences is a
  function
  
  called <kbd>append_instruction_sequences</kbd>.  It takes as arguments any
  number of instruction sequences that are to be executed sequentially;
  it appends them and returns the combined sequence.  That is, if
  $seq_1$ and $seq_2$ are sequences of instructions, then
  evaluating
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
      append_instruction_sequences($seq_1$, $seq_2$);
    
  </kbd>
  produces the sequence
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
$\textit{seq}_1$
$\textit{seq}_2$
    
  </kbd>
      </p></div>

  Whenever registers might need to be saved, the compiler's code generators use
  
  <kbd>preserving</kbd>, which is a more subtle method for combining
  instruction sequences.  <kbd>Preserving</kbd> takes three arguments: a set
  of registers and two instruction sequences that are to be executed
  sequentially.  It appends the sequences in such a way that the
  contents of each register in the set is preserved over the execution
  of the first sequence, if this is needed for the execution of the
  second sequence.  That is, if the first sequence modifies the register
  and the second sequence actually needs the register's original
  contents, then <kbd>preserving</kbd> wraps a <kbd>save</kbd> and a <kbd>restore</kbd>
  of the register around the first sequence before appending the
  sequences.  Otherwise, <kbd>preserving</kbd> simply returns the appended
  instruction sequences.  Thus, for example,
  <kbd class='snippet'>
    
    
      preserving(list($\textit{reg}_1$, $\textit{reg}_2$), $\textit{seq}_1$, $\textit{seq}_2$);
    
  </kbd>
  produces one of the following four sequences of instructions, depending on how
  $\textit{seq}_1$ and $\textit{seq}_2$ use $\textit{reg}_1$ and $\textit{reg}_2$:

  By using <kbd>preserving</kbd> to combine instruction sequences the
  compiler avoids unnecessary stack operations.  This also isolates the
  details of whether or not to generate <kbd>save</kbd> and <kbd>restore</kbd>
  instructions within the <kbd>preserving</kbd>
  function, separating them
  from the concerns that arise in writing each of the individual code
  generators.
  In fact no <kbd>save</kbd> or <kbd>restore</kbd> instructions are explicitly
  produced by the code generators.

  In principle, we could represent an instruction sequence simply as a
  list of instructions.  <kbd>Append_instruction_sequences</kbd> could then
  combine instruction sequences by performing an ordinary list <kbd>append</kbd>.  However, <kbd>preserving</kbd> would then be a complex operation,
  because it would have to analyze each instruction sequence to
  determine how the sequence uses its registers.  <kbd>Preserving</kbd>
  would be inefficient as well as complex, because it would have to
  analyze each of its instruction sequence arguments, even though these
  sequences might themselves have been constructed by calls to <kbd>preserving</kbd>, in which case their parts would have already been
  analyzed.  To avoid such repetitious analysis we will associate with each
  instruction sequence some information about its register use.
  When we construct a basic instruction sequence we
  will provide this information explicitly,
  and the
  functions
  that combine instruction sequences will derive
  register-use information for the combined sequence from the
  information associated with the component sequences.

  An instruction sequence will contain three pieces of information:
  <UL>
    <LI>the set of registers that must be initialized before the
      instructions in the sequence are executed (these registers are said to
      be <EM>needed</EM> by the sequence),
    </LI>
    <LI>the set of registers whose values are modified by the
      instructions in the sequence, and
    </LI>
    <LI>the actual instructions (also called <EM>statements</EM>) in
      the sequence.
    </LI>
  </UL>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p13' class='permalink'></a><p>
  We will represent an instruction sequence as a list of its three
  parts.  The constructor for instruction sequences is thus

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_114_4_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function make_instruction_sequence(needs, modifies, statements) {
    return list(needs, modifies,statements);
}
</pre></div></div>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p14' class='permalink'></a><p>
  For example, the two-instruction sequence that looks up the value of
  the variable <kbd>x</kbd> in the current environment, assigns the result
  to <kbd>val</kbd>, and then returns, requires registers <kbd>env</kbd> and <kbd>continue</kbd> to have been initialized, and modifies register <kbd>val</kbd>.
  This sequence would therefore be constructed as

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_114_5_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
make_instruction_sequence(list("env", "continue"),
                          list("val"),
                          list(assign("val", op("lookup_variable_value"), constant("x"), reg("env")),
                               go_to(reg("continue"))));
</pre></div></div>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p15' class='permalink'></a><p>
  We sometimes need to construct an instruction sequence with no statements:
  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_114_6_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'><pre class='prettyprint no-eval'>
function empty_instruction_sequence() {
    return make_instruction_sequence(list(), list(), list());
}
</pre></div></div>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>

  functions
  for combining instruction sequences are shown in
  section \ref{sec:combining-instruction-sequences}.

\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  In evaluating a
  function
  application, the explicit-control evaluator
  always saves and restores
  the <kbd>env</kbd> register around the evaluation of the operator, saves and
  restores <kbd>env</kbd> around the evaluation of each operand (except the
  final one), saves and restores <kbd>argl</kbd> around the evaluation of each
  operand, and saves and restores <kbd>proc</kbd> around the evaluation of the
  operand sequence.  For each of the following combinations, say which
  of these <kbd>save</kbd> and <kbd>restore</kbd> operations are superfluous and
  thus could be eliminated by the compiler's <kbd>preserving</kbd> mechanism:

  <div class='snippet' id='javascript_114_7_div'><div class='pre-prettyprint'></div></div>
      
\end{Exercise}


      
\stepcounter{ExerciseDisplayNumber}
\begin{Exercise}

  
  
  Using the <kbd>preserving</kbd> mechanism, the compiler will avoid saving
  and restoring <kbd>env</kbd> around the evaluation of the operator of a
  combination in the case where the operator is a symbol.  We could also
  build such optimizations into the evaluator.  Indeed, the
  explicit-control evaluator of section \ref{sec:eceval} already
  performs a similar optimization, by treating combinations with no
  operands as a special case.
  
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item{
      Extend the explicit-control evaluator to recognize as a separate class
      of expressions combinations whose operator is a symbol, and to take
      advantage of this fact in evaluating such expressions.
    }
\item{
      Alyssa P. Hacker suggests that by extending the evaluator to recognize
      more and more special cases we could incorporate all the compiler's
      optimizations, and that this would eliminate the advantage of compilation
      altogether.  What do you think of this idea?
    }
