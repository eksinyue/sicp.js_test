  When designing a machine to perform a computation, we would often
  prefer to arrange for components to be shared by different parts of
  the computation rather than duplicate the components.  Consider a
  machine that includes two GCD computations—one that finds the GCD of
  the contents of registers {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$} and one that finds the
  GCD of the contents of registers {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$c$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$d$}.  We might start
  by assuming we have a primitive {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$} operation, then expand the
  two instances of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$} in terms of more primitive operations.
  Figure~\ref{fig:gcd-machine-1} shows just the GCD portions of the
  resulting machine's data paths, without showing how they connect to
  the rest of the machine.  The figure also shows the corresponding
  portions of the machine's controller sequence.

  This machine has two remainder operation boxes and two boxes for
  testing equality.  If the duplicated components are complicated, as is the
  remainder box, this will not be an economical way to build the
  machine.  We can avoid duplicating the data-path components by using
  the same components for both GCD computations, provided that doing so
  will not affect the rest of the larger machine's computation.  If the
  values in registers {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$} are not needed by the time the
  controller gets to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd-2$} (or if these values can be moved to
  other registers for safekeeping), we can change the machine so that
  it uses registers {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$}, rather than registers {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$c$}
  and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$d$}, in computing the second GCD as well as the first.  If we
  do this, we obtain the controller sequence shown in
  figure~\ref{fig:gcd-machine-2}.

  We have removed the duplicate data-path components
  (so that the data paths are again as in figure~\ref{fig:gcd-machine}),
  but the controller
  now has two GCD sequences that differ only in their entry-point
  labels.  It would be better to replace these two sequences by branches
  to a single sequence—a {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$} <EM>subroutine</EM>—at the end of
  which we branch back to the correct place in the main instruction
  sequence.  We can accomplish this as follows: Before branching to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$}, we place a distinguishing value (such as 0 or~1) into a special
  register, 
  
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$continue$}.  At the end of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$} subroutine we
  return either to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$after-gcd-1$} or to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$after-gcd-2$}, depending
  on the value of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$continue$} register.
  Figure~\ref{fig:gcd-machine-2cont} shows the relevant portion of the
  resulting controller sequence, which includes only a single copy of the
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$} instructions.

  This is a reasonable approach for handling small problems, but it
  would be awkward if there were many instances of GCD computations in
  the controller sequence.  To decide where to continue executing after
  the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$} subroutine, we would need tests in the data paths and
  branch instructions in the controller for all the places that use {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$}.
  A more powerful method for implementing subroutines is to have
  the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$continue$} register hold the label of the entry point in the
  controller sequence at which execution should continue when the subroutine is finished.
  Implementing this strategy requires a new
  kind of connection between the data paths and the controller of a
  register machine: There must be a way to assign to a register a label
  in the controller sequence in such a way that this value can be fetched
  from the register and used to continue execution at the designated
  entry point.

  To reflect this ability, we will extend the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$assign$}
  instruction of the register-machine language to allow a register to be
  assigned as value a label from the controller sequence (as a special
  kind of constant).  We will also extend the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$go_to$} instruction to
  allow execution to continue at the entry point described by the
  contents of a register rather than only at an entry point described by
  a constant label.  Using these new constructs we can terminate the
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd$} subroutine with a branch to the location stored in the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$continue$} register.  This leads to the controller sequence shown in
  figure~\ref{fig:gcd-mach-2labels}.

  A machine with more than one subroutine could use multiple
  continuation registers (e.g., {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$gcd-continue$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$factorial-continue$}) or we could have all subroutines share a single
  {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$continue$} register.  Sharing is more economical, but we must be
  careful if we have a subroutine ({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sub1$}) that calls another
  subroutine ({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sub2$}).  Unless {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sub1$} saves the contents of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$continue$} in some other register before setting up {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$continue$} for
  the call to {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sub2$}, {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$sub1$} will not know where to go when it
  is finished.  The mechanism developed in the next section to handle
  recursion also provides a better solution to this problem of nested
  subroutine calls.
