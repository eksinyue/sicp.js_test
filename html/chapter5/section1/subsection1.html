  Data-path and controller diagrams are adequate for representing simple
  machines such as GCD, but they are unwieldy for describing large
  machines such as a JavaScript interpreter.  To make it possible to deal with complex machines, we will create a language that presents, in textual
  form, all the information given by the data-path and controller
  diagrams.  We will start with a notation that directly mirrors the diagrams.
      </p></div>

  We define the data paths of a machine by describing the registers and
  the operations.  To describe a register, we give it a name
  and specify the buttons that control assignment to it.  We give each
  of these buttons a name and specify the source of the data that enters
  the register under the button's control.  (The source is a register, a
  constant, or an operation.)
  To describe an operation, we give
  it a name and specify its inputs (registers or constants).
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p3' class='permalink'></a><p>
  We define the controller of a machine as a sequence of 
  
  <EM>
    instructions</EM> together with 
  
  
  <EM>labels</EM> that identify <EM>entry
    points</EM> in the sequence. An instruction is one of the following:
  <UL>
    <LI>The name of a data-path button to push to assign a value to
      a register.  (This corresponds to a box in the controller diagram.)

      
      
    </LI>
    <LI>A {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$test$} instruction, that performs a specified test.

      
      
      
      
    </LI>
    <LI>A conditional branch ({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$branch$} instruction) to a
      location indicated by a controller label, based on the result of the
      previous test.  (The test and branch together correspond to a diamond
      in the controller diagram.)  If the test is false, the controller
      should continue with the next instruction in the sequence.  Otherwise,
      the controller should continue with the instruction after the label.

      
      
    </LI>
    <LI>An unconditional branch ({\lstinline[mathescape=true]$go_to$} instruction) naming a
      controller label at which to continue execution.
    </LI>

  </UL>
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p4' class='permalink'></a><p>
  The machine starts at the beginning of the controller instruction
  sequence and stops when execution reaches the end of the sequence.
  Except when a branch changes the flow of control, instructions are
  executed in the order in which they are listed.

    registers(
        list(
            pair(name("a"),
                 buttons(name("a<-b"), source(register("b")))),
            pair(name("b"),
                 buttons(name("b<-t"), source(register("t")))),

  Figure~\ref{fig:gcd-machine-spec} shows the GCD machine described in
  this way.  This example only hints at the generality of these
  descriptions, since the GCD machine is a very simple case: Each
  register has only one button, and each button and test is used only
  once in the controller.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p6' class='permalink'></a><p>
  Unfortunately, it is difficult to read such a description.  In order
  to understand the controller instructions we must constantly refer
  back to the definitions of the button names and the operation names,
  and to understand what the buttons do we may have to refer to the
  definitions of the operation names.  We will thus transform our
  notation to combine the information from the data-path and controller
  descriptions so that we see it all together.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p7' class='permalink'></a><p>
  To obtain this form of description, we will replace the arbitrary
  button and operation names by the definitions of their behavior.  That
  is, instead of saying (in the controller) <QUOTE>Push button {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$t<-r$}</QUOTE>
  and separately saying (in the data paths) <QUOTE>Button {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$t<-r$} assigns
    the value of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rem$} operation to register {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$t$}</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>The
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rem$} operation's inputs are the contents of registers
    
    
    
    
    
    
    {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$},</QUOTE> we will say (in the controller) <QUOTE>Push the
    button that assigns to register {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$t$} the value of the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$rem$}
    operation on the contents of registers {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$}.</QUOTE>
  Similarly, instead of saying (in the controller) <QUOTE>Perform the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$=$} test</QUOTE> and separately saying (in the data paths) <QUOTE>The {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$=$} test operates on the contents of register {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$} and the
    constant 0,</QUOTE> we will say <QUOTE>Perform the {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$=$} test on the
    
    
    contents of register {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$b$} and the constant 0.</QUOTE>  We will omit the
  data-path description, leaving only the controller sequence.  Thus,
  the GCD machine is described as follows:

  
\begin{JavaScript}
controller(
     "test-b",
     list(test(list(op("="), reg(b), constant(0))),
          branch(label("gcd-done")),
          assign("t", list(op("rem"), reg("a"), reg("b"))),
          assign("a", reg(b)),
          assign("b", reg(t)),
          go_to(label("test-b"))),
     "gcd-done");
\end{JavaScript}

      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p8' class='permalink'></a><p>
  This form of description is easier to read than the kind illustrated
  in Figure~\ref{fig:gcd-machine-spec}, but it also has disadvantages:
  <UL>
    
    <LI>It is more verbose for large machines,
      because complete descriptions of the data-path elements are repeated
      whenever the elements are mentioned in the controller instruction
      sequence.  (This is not a problem in the GCD example, because each
      operation and button is used only once.)  Moreover, repeating the
      data-path descriptions obscures the actual data-path structure of the
      machine; it is not obvious for a large machine how many registers,
      operations, and buttons there are and how they are interconnected.

    </LI>
    <LI>Because the controller instructions in a machine definition
      look like JavaScript expressions, it is easy to forget that they are
      not arbitrary JavaScript expressions.  They can notate only legal machine
      operations.  For example, operations can operate directly only on
      constants and the contents of registers, not on the results of other
      operations.
    </LI>

  </UL>

  In spite of these disadvantages, we will use this register-machine
  language throughout this chapter, because we will be more concerned with
  understanding controllers than with understanding the elements and
  connections in data paths.  We should keep in mind,
  however, that data-path design is crucial in designing real machines.

  Let us modify the GCD machine so that we can type in the numbers
  whose GCD we want and get the answer printed at our terminal.  We will
  not discuss how to make a machine that can read and print, but will
  assume (as we do when we use {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$prompt$} and {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$display$} in
  JavaScript) that
  they are available as primitive operations.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p11' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  The operation {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$read$} is like the operations we have been using in that it
  produces a value that can be stored in a register.  But {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$read$}
  does not take inputs from any registers; its value depends on
  something that happens outside the parts of the machine we are
  designing.  We will allow our machine's operations to have such
  behavior, and thus will draw and notate the use of {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$read$} just as
  we do any other operation that computes a value.
      </p></div>

      <div class='permalink'>
<a name='p12' class='permalink'></a><p>
  
  The operation {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$print$}, on the other hand, differs from the operations we have
  been using in a fundamental way: It does not produce an output value
  to be stored in a register.  Though it has an effect, this effect is
  not on a part of the machine we are designing.  We will refer to this
  kind of operation as an <EM>action</EM>.  We will represent an action in
  a data-path diagram just as we represent an operation that computes a
  value—as a trapezoid that contains the name of the action.
  Arrows point to the action box from any inputs (registers or
  constants).  We also associate a button with the action.  Pushing the
  button makes the action happen.  To make a controller push an action
  
  
  button we use a new kind of instruction called {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$perform$}.  Thus,
  the action of printing the contents of register {\lstinline[mathescape=true]$a$} is represented
  in a controller sequence by the instruction
  
\begin{JavaScript}
perform(list(op("print"), reg("a")))
\end{JavaScript}

  Figure~\ref{fig:gcd-with-io} shows the data paths and controller for
  the new GCD machine.  Instead of having the machine stop after
  printing the answer, we have made it start over, so that it repeatedly
  reads a pair of numbers, computes their GCD, and prints the result.
  This structure is like the driver loops we used in the interpreters of
  chapter~4.
